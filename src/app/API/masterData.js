      "Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",
    about_book:
      "This book delves deep into the works of Sri Aurobindo to present a compelling and fascinating collage of his multifaceted and multidimensional genius, who is not only one of the greatest political leaders of modern times but a supreme visionary, thinker par excellence, great scholar and writer, spiritual guide and statesman, and a leader of all humanity. The author presents perspectives on his vast oeuvre as a darshanik and shares his exalted dream and aspiration for India and humanity, his horizonless ranges that are their own skylines, his lights, and his snow-capped peaks. It gives a glimpse into Sri Aurobindo’s pragmatic integral philosophy that is unique in being Vedantic in essence yet modern in expression and outlook.",

      "You know, Jasbir, I think we are the only father-son duo in the unit’s history to have been both decorated for gallantry! Also, there is so much of the unit’s history that needs to be properly probed and recorded. It is your time now, and you must do it.” ‘Fighting Fourth’ or 4th Battalion, The Kumaon Regiment (4 Kumaon), raised in 1788, has fought with distinction and etched its name in the annals of Indian military history with honour and pride. From ﬁghting the Pindaris to quelling the Boxer Rebellion in Hong Kong, the battalion saw extensive action in both the World Wars and the Indo-Pak war of 1947–48, where the gallant actions of the unit saved Kashmir Valley for the Indian Union and changed the course of history in the region. Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded India’s ﬁrst Param Vir Chakra, the highest award for gallantry, while Brigadier Pritam Singh emerged as the Saviour of Poonch. The unit was awarded Battle Honour ‘Srinagar’ and 57 awards for bravery, including one Param Vir Chakra, three Maha Vir Chakras, 13 Vir Chakras, one Bar to Vir Chakra and other awards. In the Indo–Pak War 1965, the battalion was awarded Battle Honour ‘Sanjoi–Mirpur’, while in the 1971 operations, it was awarded Battle Honour ‘Shamshernagar’, along with three Vir Ckakras, one SM and other awards. In this book, Brigadier Jasbir presents an intimate, personal account of the glorious history of this ﬁne battalion that has contributed no less than two Chiefs of Staff of the Indian Army and is among the most highly-decorated ones. Brigadier Jasbir Singh, SM, is a Rimcollian who studied at RIMC from 1962 to 1966. Thereafter, he underwent training at NDA Khadakwasla, followed by IMA Dehradun, where he was commissioned in the 4th Battalion, The Kumaon Regiment, or 4 Kumaon (Fighting Fourth).

      "Jinan believes, the cognitive right as the most fundamental right which modernity—society and school—brutally takes away right from childhood. He considers himself to be someone who was able to recover from the damage of schooling and modernity when he got an opportunity to be with indigenous people. His experience with the illiterate artisans helped him to understand the process of creation of life-sustaining knowledge, its holistic nature and also how children learn autonomously. He is engaged in an ongoing research on the true nature of learning—why, what and how. He has been working on natural learning, children and cognitive damages inflicted by Modernity and Modern Schooling for almost three decades now. Currently, Jinan is involved in enabling people to explore and experientially recover their natural cognitive system damaged by schooling.

    about_book:
      "Seeing with Hands is a result of a unique experiment and extensive research by the author, Jinan K.B., and his foundation. It is a record of how children express their experiences through drawing (not art) and how drawing becomes a tool that helps them observe the world around them. Showcasing brilliant drawings made by children to express themselves, the book attempts to prove that they are naturally equipped to adapt and learn autonomously. This book is bound to prompt a new way of thinking on educating children, helping them develop their cognitive tools and provide insights to all those who are concerned with children, be it parents, teachers or caretakers.",

      "Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",

      "This book is a significant addition to the growing body of literature on Sri Aurobindo. Dr. Singh delves deep into the works of Sri Aurobindo to present a compelling and fascinating collage of the philosopher’s multifaceted and multidimensional genius: Sri Aurobindo as seer and mystic, as visionary and poet, as writer, translator, linguist and critic, and as India’s first spiritual nationalist. Sri Aurobindo, as this book declares, a true fountainhead of India’s literary renaissance, needs to be discovered and better appreciated not just in India, but globally, and Dr Singh has given an incredible tribute to the saint with this exceptional book.",

    about_book:
      "Snakes in the Ganga unveils uncomfortable truths concerning India’s vulnerabilities: Intense warfare against India’s integrity is the work of a wellorchestrated global machinery driven by a new ideology. Marxism has been reincarnated as critical race theory in US academia and serves as the framework to address America’s racism. This has been recklessly mapped on to India: Caste is equated with Race. Marginalized communities of India are considered as Blacks and Brahmins as the Whites of India. Groups claiming grievances (like Muslims and LGBTQ+) are artificially clubbed together. Popularly called the woke movement, the mission is to dismantle Indian civilization and heritage by waging an uncompromising war against India’s government, educational institutions, culture, industry, and society. Harvard University is ground zero of these social theories developed in collaboration with Indian scholars, activists, journalists, and artists. This represents a clear and present danger to India’s sovereignty and national security. Several Indian elites are hoisting Harvard as the vishwa guru with their money and family names. Some private universities within India are importing wokeism that has serious repercussions for India’s stability. Indian corporates are bringing the latest Western rubric of environmental, social, and governance ratings into their workplaces. This is aligned with the global social justice movement. China has exploited this latest infrastructure as a passage to India. Wokeism has penetrated some of the Indian government’s policies. For instance, the National Education Policy 2020 is propagating Harvard’s liberal arts. An entire ecosystem of ideologies, institutions, and young leaders is emerging for the recolonization of India. Is India for sale? In this paperback edition, the back matter has been trimmed to shed some weight in the interest of portability. Readers can, however, still access it by scanning the QR code printed after the last chapter.",

      "Ankush Sam Thorpe grew up in Punjab, a northern province in India in the 90s. A graduate in Anthropology and a postgraduate in Genetics, his fascination for science began early in life. In his early teens, he was obsessed with 90s Hollywood science fiction films, especially The Terminator and Jurassic Park. His love affair with science fiction began with the Sidney Sheldon novel The Doomsday Conspiracy and solidified with Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol and George Orwell’s 1984. However, his passion for storytelling grew with Isaac Asimov’s short story Nightfall, which inspired him to create his own tales. In 2011, at the age of twenty, Ankush wrote his first short story, ‘A Stitch in Time’, exhibiting his fascination with science and history. During the Covid pandemic he found the time to create characters, dialogues, and storylines based on the scientific concepts that keep him enthralled to this date. Presently living in the city of Toronto, he continues to pen more stories with science as the central theme. In addition, he is an Instagram junkie as well as a die-hard Test Cricket fan.",

      "We speak often of the Hindu religion, of the Sanatan Dharma, but few of us really know what that religion is...This is the Dharma that for the salvation of humanity was cherished in the seclusion of this peninsula from of old. It is to give this religion that India is rising. She does not rise as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, to trample on the weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted to her over the world. India has always existed for humanity and not for herself and it is for humanity and not for herself that she must be great”. These are the words of Maharshi Sri Aurobindo. But what is this, Sanatan Dharma? Is it just the religion and rituals that Hindus follow or is it really the secret of Life and Consciousness that is embedded in the very fabric of our cosmic existence? This book reveals the inner layers of Sanatan Dharma and is meant for everyone interested in the truths of our human existence in this vast and endless universe. It is a book that will surely put to rest the myths and misunderstandings about Sanatan Dharma as a religion and a philosophy",

      "Pariksith Singh, MD, is a practicing physician of 30 years. Board Certified in Internal Medicine, he believes unsettling changes in the healthcare industry can also be transformative. “For me it is a time for remarkable opportunity, growth, and innovation,” he says. “I can look back at what I have accomplished, but also look forward in eager anticipation at what is possible.” Dr. Singh watched his organization, Access Health Care Physicians, LLC, grow from a simple, multi-service provider in 2001 to one that has multiplied in size and is now respected throughout the state of Florida. In addition to heading up this leading IPA, he has started a healthcare HMO, an ACO, and created one of the best healthcare corporate infrastructures in the business. Dr. Singh also finds time to be a published poet, philosopher and author. His medical contributions include The Florida Guide to Prescription, Controlled Substance and Pain Medicine Laws (coauthored by Rachel Barlow, Alan Gassman, and Lester Perling), The Essential Planning Guide to 2013 Income & Estate Taxes, and Excerpts From Creditor Protection From Florida Physicians, a Comprehensive Handbook for Physicians and Their Advisors. Add to this the fictional works of Dr. Singh - The Shoreless River, Chutti Ke Din, and his favorite, Riddles for Pesky Teenagers. This is Dr. Singh’s fifth edition of A Primer in Health Care. In addition to publishing books on cutting- edge topics of interest to physicians and administrators, his organization is now a learning organization involving Graduate Medical Education residents.",

      "A Magisterial work by Neelakandan to understand what Hindutva actually is and stands for.' - Dr. Vikram Sampath 'I have long admired Aravindan Neelakandan as one of the very few Indian thinkers who appreciate and acknowledge Western-derived science and modernity, while simultaneously remaining authentically grounded in Hindu tradition. There have been many books on the history of Hinduism and Hindutva, but this one is different, and significant, because it (correctly) takes a step back and identifies that our current situation is part of a global bio-psycho-sociological churn, something playing out over millennia, far beyond the lifespans of any one individual or organization or state. Aravindan, at his core, is a nature-lover and a scientist, and it is this perspective that suffuses this book and makes it special. While there is plenty of ground-breaking content within this expansive, encyclopedic book, I believe the sections on the neurobiological connections of Hindu meditative and ritual practice, which tie the history of Hinduism to the broader evolutionary inheritance of the human species, are going to be very impactful in the years to come.' - Dr Anand Venkatraman Neuroscientist",

It offers a unique perspective for Young India, as the author is a military history writer with vast exposure to various parts of the subcontinent. The book's brutal honesty and its cinematic unfolding of events will captivate the reader. The author was raised in an Army family and had a formative childhood shaped by his mother and schooling at St. Joseph's Academy and Doon School. He later graduated from Madras Christian College and worked with Tiger Tops Mountain Travel before becoming a journalist, filmmaker, and writer. He has produced classic films and authored books, including the Northeast Trilogy and two books about wars. Currently working on a Value Education Program for schools to bring India to Indians.",
    about_book:
      "The book is a Force 12 hurricane, dropping only to a 10 gale now and then, for it sweeps one along breathlessly from incident to incident, place to place, name to name. From the arresting prologue itself, the book is brutally honest, exhilarating and even self-deprecating. It is a story that most of Young India must read, for it provides an incredible ring-side view to critical events in the 1980s and 90s that shaped the destiny of the nation. The author’s subsequent credentials as a military history writer, his earlier works and his vast exposure to virtually every part of the subcontinent, place him in a unique position to paint scenario after scenario where the reader is completely mesmerised by the cinematic unfolding of events. Which genre does this book fit into? This autobiography, however, doesn’t depend on his earlier works for its literary place: it is sui generis, defiant of classification. The nearest one can come to is to call it a thriller in the garb of a life story in the first person - for it is Shiv Kunal’s life story. And it reads like a thriller because it is incredible; the more so, because it is wholly true. His being the son of a distinguished general from a famous regiment may have helped, but not all army brats, however exalted, have this devil’s own luck. It is the kind of life most only dream of, and very few (if any) have the good fortune to live and write about.",

      "Nitya is haunted by the pronouncement that he has “forgotten to live.” He leaves Suvastu, his childhood home, and the obsessive, matriarchal world of the Ammalkans to embark on journeys that will bring him in contact with the mercurial Umi whose life is vitalized by a strange discovery; Purusha, the revolutionary, who believes self-awareness must always be translated into action; the eccentric Govi who dreams of the red clouds of Jupiter; Aniyathi, whose attempt to build a life of her own is overtaken by violence and grief; and, most crucially of all, Chinma, the charismatic “guru” who seeks siddhis or psychic powers. A world of mango and biryani lovers, ghosts and philosophers, music and theyyams and calamitous natural disasters. A world full of stories about the secret worlds we inhabit. Stories that happened a long time ago and will most certainly happen again. Told from multiple perspectives and weaving past and present, dreams and reality, All Stray Dogs Go to Heaven is an astounding debut novel by Krishna Candeth. This unforgettable story explores the power of love, friendship, family, and the elusive idea of home, and compels us to revisit our own ideas of truth, the self and reality.",

      "Brigadier B.S. Mehta comes from an illustrious military family, with four brothers having fought in the War of 1971. Commissioned into 45 CAVALRY in 1966, he later raised the 13 Armoured Regiment. He has served in all the Strike Corps and also an Infantry and Mountain Division with distinction. He has worked on deputation with the Cabinet Secretariat. He took premature retirement in 1998 to serve as Director with the Government of Gujarat. He ran the first course for retiring defence personnel at the Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Ahmedabad in 2000, which became the forerunner for similar courses run by Indian Institutes of Management. He spent the next 16 years in Higher Education to finally demit as Vice Chancellor of Maharishi University of Management and Technology in 2016. Post retirement, he works as an advisor to Gujarat-based NGOs helping families and dependents of martyrs.",
    about_book:
      "Raising a regiment is like riding bareback. The struggle is harder; the sweat, toil and tears unending. The reward is confidence in our own abilities, an understanding and respect for the esprit de corps of the cavalry, and regimental pride.’ From the annals of Indian military history comes the glorious tale of the raising of 13 Armoured Regiment — India’s only armoured regiment raised with a unique class composition of Sikh, Rajput and South Indian Classes. Brigadier Balram Singh Mehta, a veteran of the 1971 war, was reverted from RAW by General A.S. Vaidya, then Chief of Army Staff, to raise 13 AR. The regiment was raised in December 1984, in the aftermath of Operation Blue Star, a time of national turmoil and security concerns in India. Through an engaging narrative, this book weaves together the many personal and professional challenges undertaken by the unit’s officers and its first commandant, Brigadier B.S. Mehta, for the unit to be declared fit for war and assigned to an infantry division. In January 1987 while two of its squadrons participated in the Republic Day Parade at New Delhi and Allahabad, 13 AR was mobilized at short notice and inducted into a Strike RAPID Formation deployed in the desert for Exercise Brasstacks under General Hanut Singh. Pakistan’s nervous response led to President Zia-ul-Haq deploying his Army Reserves opposite Punjab, creating a warlike situation that led to a moment of truth for the leadership in politics, diplomacy and the armed forces of both nations.",

      "This book is part of a series that started with the flagship Snakes in the Ganga: Breaking India 2.0 in September 2022. The present volume focuses on the American project led by Harvard University to dismantle the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other institutions of excellence in India, by claiming that they propagate structural casteism. While it is beyond the scope of this book to discuss in detail Marxism, Postmodernism and other European intellectual movements of the last 150 years, the fact is that these movements have influenced what has culminated in this current battle against the IITs. Simply put, we will show that: The IITs are under attack. There are legal implications of this attack. It has severe consequences for the IITs, its students and faculty, India, and engineering education. The consequences of this attack will follow the IIT engineer and other tech professionals to their workplace anywhere in the world. Harvard’s Woke machinery is behind this attack and we need to understand the sophistication that backs it. Our evidence-based rebuttal gives IITians and other engineers the toolkit to tackle false accusations of being casteist bigots. We end with a call to action by IITians and other stakeholders.",

    about_book:
      "Evocatively titled, Of Newtons and Apples: Insights into 50 Great Minds in Human History does exactly what it promises. It gives us a glimpse into the professional and personal lives of 50 great personalities whose names, in some cases, are a part of everyday conversation, while in others, they are familiar names about whom we know little. Just the way the falling of an apple led to major discoveries by Newton, this work tries to identify sources of the genius of the personalities across human history. These men and women were either creators or those who redefined the course of history in their field of work. Interestingly, each article focuses on a major achievement and one aspect of their personal lives. Such sharpness makes the articles short, engaging and, in many cases, poetic. The classification of personalities into Building, Doing and Thinking gives us new eyes to look at them once again and debate within ourselves, the fuzzy boundaries that exist between these three primary human activities.",

      "The author, Bimal Chakravartty, was born in Kashi, where he spent his adolescent years. However, since his father was with the Indian Railways, he has lived in many parts of India as well. He lost his father at a very young age, and thus, his career took up a greater part of his youth. He never gave up what he liked, though - reading. Reading books written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindra Nath Tagore, Bibutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, and others has always fascinated and intrigued him. Currently, he resides in Noida, where he spends time both reading classics and writing some himself as well. He is, what many would say, a probashi Bengali - one who is not from Kolkata. But, his command over the language and his expressions and thoughts are all very much a reflection of the 'City of Joy'. Probashir Golpo Shongroho, his second book, the first being his autobiography, Jana Awjanar Majhe, is as, if not more, poetic, soulful, and warm as his first novel was.",
    about_book:
      "When suave writing is interwoven with simplicity, then we get a book like Probashir Golpo Shongroho. A collection of 21 stories from the author of the much-appreciated autobiography, Jana Awjanar Majhe, they peek into the author’s life, his thoughts, and his soul. The stories are layered beauties – how else would you explain a horror story speaking of ‘sorry is still so tough to say’ or the tale of how the author had gotten saved from many neardeath experiences talking subtly about ‘when the Lord protects us, we can defy death’. Each story is not more than three to four pages long, but the music that he plays with the words, moving from one note to another, surprising the reader with the unexpected, shows the deftness of the author’s writing skills. He might be a fan of the stalwarts of Bengali literature, but he, himself, is definitely one too.",

    about_book:
      "Embedded within the primary narrative of the Mahabharata lie numerous sub-tales known as upakhyaanas or upakathas. These lesser known stories play a vital role in completing the grand tapestry of the Mahabharata, thus giving this book its apt title. Unlike verse translations found in unabridged versions, the 67 upakathas presented here serve a different purpose. While they may appear as diversions, these narratives serve as vital threads, connecting the text and offering answers to lingering questions that readers may have. For instance, why did Ambaa, the princess of Kaashi, become the catalyst for Bheeshma’s demise in a later life? The Ambaa upakhyaana holds the answers. Similarly, the stories of Sage Parashuraama reveal why a brahmana like him possessed warrior-like qualities. Two upakhyaanas shed light on this enigma. Additionally, the Yayaati upakhyaana elucidates the reasons behind the Kurus descending from Puru, Yayaati’s youngest son, rather than the eldest.

    about_book:
      "To those who claim we are now living in a totalitarian, fascist, Hindu Rashtra, one must ask: What kind of a Hindu Rashtra is this where a billion-strong Hindus have been, through our parliament, through our courts, our education system, and our constitution, reduced to not just second-class but, rather, eighth-class citizens? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Ram Navami, Hanuman Jayanti, Durga pooja processions, and even Garba celebrations, are attacked and stoned with impunity? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where a sitting Prime minister says minorities have the first right to resources? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindus are forced to be refugees in their own land, where one can settle 40,000 Rohingya Muslims but not 700,000 Kashmiri Hindus, the land’s original inhabitants; where the judiciary says it is too late to prosecute those who raped, murdered, and ethnically cleansed lacs of Hindus? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindu temples are exclusively controlled by the State, where Hindus must beg for Waqf land to celebrate their festival while the government usurps hundreds of thousands of acres of temple land and is responsible for more than 100,000 temples losing lakhs of crores in rental income? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where the Right to Education Act discriminates only against Hindus and their schools, forcing tens of thousands of them to shut down? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where monsters like Aurangzeb and Tipu who perpetrated large-scale Hindu genocides are eulogised through State sponsored publications, naming of roads and cities, and organising of festivals? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where a law was about to be enacted through with only the Hindus would have been held guilty in a communal riot even if they were in a minority for example in Kashmir? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where court judgments like the Sabarimala and legislative enactments like the Hindu Code Bill purport to reform only Hindu religious practices but dare not touch practices of other religions, and if they do, the decisions are promptly reversed like in the Shah Bano case? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where The Places of Worship Act continues to deny the Hindus their legitimate right to correct historical injustices and reclaim thousands of demolished temples? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where the Waqf Act gives overarching powers to Muslims to declare a 1500-year-old Hindu temple to be on Islamic land when Islam is only 1300 years old? If this is how a Hindu is rewarded in a Hindu Rashtra, he’d much rather be in a Muslim Rashtra because then at least there’d be no pretence of equality - a Kafir will get what he deserves. In this searing commentary penned with clinical precision, the author shreds to smithereens once and for all the guilt-tripping, self-loathing fake narrative that Hindus have been duped with since Independence. There is no pretence, no political correctness, only unvarnished truth – that the Hindus are living under State-sanctioned Apartheid.",

    about_book:
      "When QUTUB-UD-DIN AIBAK died in a polo game 1210, he had left behind a rickety, fledgling Muslim kingdom in Delhi. For the next eighty-odd years, its fortunes swayed wildly, witnessing a record twelve kings. It was a period of incessant palace coups and serial political murders. The death of Balban extinguishes the so-called Muslim Slave dynasty and with it ends the short-lived Turkic Muslim imperialism. It also heralds the ascent of the Afghanistan-based Khaljis, classed as “low-born.” A straight line connects the origin of the Khaljis with the military airport built by the US in Zabul in 2006. By this time, Hindu political power in northern India is in total disarray with no unifying leader who has the vision to combat and expel the alien oppressor lodged in Delhi. No Hindu ruler exploits the repeated openings and vulnerabilities provided by internecine Sultanate warfare. Book 2 of Invaders and Infidels traces the unlikely rise of Jalal-ud-din Khalji as an ill-suited monarch and ends with the maiden Islamic raid of Devagiri, the gateway to southern India. The incident will have far-reaching consequences for the history of India for the next six hundred years. It is a heady tale of a period rife with bloody intrigues, aggressive campaigns of Islamic expansionism, heroic wars of Hindu resistance and squandered chances for civilizational reclamation. The narrative in this book is marked by a flair of vivid historical storytelling, juxtaposing the oscillating fortunes of both Islamic conquests and the ensuing Hindu responses. It unearths a slew of eye-opening and forgotten details about the socio-political and economic life of the era whose impact is visible even today. Written in a fast-paced and engaging style, Book 2 of Invaders and Infidels is a riveting read of a critical juncture in the history of early Muslim rule of India.",

    about_book:
      "Little known in his own country, Sri Aurobindo was nevertheless one of the more significant personalities of 20th-century India. After studying Humanities in England, he embarked on a political struggle to challenge Britain's colonial domination over India. In 1906, he founded the newspaper Bande Mataram, laying the groundwork of India's future independence, notably through passive resistance, which was later adopted by Gandhi. But far from Gandhi's pacifism, Sri Aurobindo was convinced that freedom could only be achieved via action, and even via armed struggle. Absorbed by India's century-old wisdom, his commitment to his country was doubled by an unremitting inner spiritual quest. In 1910, Sri Aurobindo began another life in Pondicherry. In his written works, notably The Life Divine, published in 1920, he propounded an Integral Yoga describing the conditions of the The Great Passage, meant to lead to the next evolution of mankind. His work influenced and attracted disciples from around the world to his Ashram, founded in 1926, with his companion Mirra Alfassa, and later to the Auroville community, a few kilometres from Pondicherry. Through this biography, Luc Venet reveals the unfolding of Sri Aurobindo's exceptional force and opens up the path to a new evolution of humanity",

That the author does this in the light of Sri Aurobindo—inarguably among the very few who realised and lived the deepest and highest Vedic truths in their beings—makes it even more significant. This book comes at the right time too, as Indians globally begin to reawaken to their timeless Vedic and Sanatan heritage.",

    about_book:
      "India and the Changing World breaks free from conventional boundaries, delving fearlessly into the realms of emerging civilizational, religious, and historical matters. Its purpose lies in sparking essential conversations about broader matters, such as civilizational, cultural, and social diversity issues that have been overlooked in the shaping of the post-World War II and post-Cold War global order. As the existing global order confronts unprecedented challenges, this book serves as a catalyst, fueling a discourse that captures the essence of a rapidly evolving world. Through a comparative study, the book offers fresh insights into the contrasting approaches of short-termist liberal democracies and long-termist autocratic China, shedding light on the distinctive qualities of a liberal and civilizational democracy as exemplified by India. Within its illuminating pages, you will uncover the critical challenges that Indian democracy faces, navigating the complexities of its relationship with both autocratic China and the liberal West. Additionally, the book examines the fundamental differences between market economics and market societies. It artfully unravels contemporary geopolitical, geo-economic, and geostrategic issues, offering intricate analysis of India's strategic connections with select nations and its ever-growing ties with the USA. Moreover, it dares to propose innovative solutions like astronomy-based education as a means to foster conflict resolution. With an invitation that resonates deeply, India and the Changing World Order calls upon you to partake in a discourse that reevaluates the past, contextualises the present, and ultimately shapes the trajectory of our shared future.",

      "Theyyam, an ancient tradition of North Malabar, is a captivating blend of folk art, religious ritual, and profound spirituality. Gods Dancing among Men: The Mystical World of Theyyams of North Malabar delves deep into the rich history of theyyam, exploring its roots and relevance in contemporary belief and worship. This book sheds light on both the luminous and shadowy facets of this tradition as well as the enigmatic grey areas that define it. Every aspect of the theyyam cult, from the vibrant and intricate costumes to the wild and transcendent dances, is fascinating. The practitioners of theyyam display astonishing abilities, including clairvoyance, prophecy, and the power to fulfil wishes. The pantheon of theyyam includes Shaivite and Vaishnavite manifestations alongside a diverse array of Bhagvathy theyyams. Popular deities such as Muthappan, Muchilot Bhagavathi, Thee Chamundi, Gulikan, Kuttichathan, and Pottan Deiyvam hold a special place in the hearts of the people. Additionally, the theyyam tradition incorporates animals into its repertoire with performances featuring monkeys, tigers, buffaloes, crocodiles, bees, and snakes. One of the most astonishing aspects of theyyam is the fearless interaction with fire. Performers nonchalantly walk on embers and even hurl themselves onto immense mounds of fire, known as meleri, repeatedly. Despite the influence of Aryanization, the sanitizing impact of British colonial rule, the teachings of social reformers, the remarkable literacy rates, and the prevalent communist ideology in the region, the sanctity of the theyyam tradition remains unblemished. Theyyams are living gods, cherished and revered by the people of North Malabar, and their blessings hold immense significance.",

    about_book:
      "Governance is a 360-degree process; this book is an arc. New India dawned on 26 May 2014 when the Union government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi was sworn in by the president of the Republic of India. Its governance agenda was unveiled by the president in Parliament on 9 June 2014 with this stentorian statement: My government is dedicated to the poor…. With a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor, my government pledges itself to the principle of sabke saath, sabka vikas…. My government will function on the mantra of minimum government, maximum governance, and we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. The government got a second mandate in 2019. This book, which is a compilation of the authors articles and papers, will take the reader through different dimensions of governance, government, institutions, democracy and development critically, analysing the flavour of New India in them.",

      "To those who claim we are now living in a totalitarian, fascist, Hindu Rashtra, one must ask: What kind of a Hindu Rashtra is this where a billion-strong Hindus have been, through our parliament, through our courts, our education system, and our constitution, reduced to not just second-class but, rather, eighth-class citizens? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Ram Navami, Hanuman Jayanti, Durga pooja processions, and even Garba celebrations, are attacked and stoned with impunity? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where a sitting Prime minister says minorities have the first right to resources? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindus are forced to be refugees in their own land, where one can settle 40,000 Rohingya Muslims but not 700,000 Kashmiri Hindus, the land’s original inhabitants; where the judiciary says it is too late to prosecute those who raped, murdered, and ethnically cleansed lacs of Hindus? What kind of Hindu Rashtra is this where Hindu temples are exclusively controlled by the State, where Hindus must beg for Waqf land to celebrate their festival while the government usurps hundreds of thousands of acres of temple land and is responsible for more than 100,000 temples losing lakhs of crores in rental income? … If this is how a Hindu is rewarded in a Hindu Rashtra, he’d much rather be in a Muslim Rashtra because then at least there’d be no pretence of equality - a Kafir will get what he deserves. In this searing commentary penned with clinical precision, the author shreds to smithereens once and for all the guilt-tripping, self-loathing fake narrative that Hindus have been duped with since Independence. There is no pretence, no political correctness, only unvarnished truth – that the Hindus are living under State-sanctioned Apartheid. About The Author- Anand Ranganathan is a scientist and an author. His forthcoming book is on Indias forgotten scientists. Hindus in Hindu Rashtra is his first non-fiction book.",

    about_book:
      "A civilization that forgets its struggles is condemned to repeat its mistakes and spiral into a self-destructive cycle. The battles for freedom and the resistance against occupation and atrocities all too often recede from collective memory, overshadowed by the weight of oppression and systematically orchestrated efforts to erase the Hindu identity through manipulated narratives. The sacred geography of Bharat, the cradle of Hindu dharma and the ancestral home of the Hindu people, has borne witness to relentless invasions, leaving scars on the collective psyche. The Ram Janmabhoomi movement stands as a poignant testament to the devastation inflicted upon the roots of Hindu civilization and the arduous battle to reclaim it. In an era dominated by weaponized narratives, where the perpetrators of atrocities are romanticised as victims and the victims are crowned as oppressors, this book reminds of the facts and the inconvenient truths—of the blood, sweat and tears that many Hindus shed in fighting the good fight. It is a call to ensure that every Hindu born in an age, removed from those trials and tribulations, never forgets the sacrifices made by those who went before them. For if we forget, we are complicit in normalising the obliteration of our great civilization.",

    about_book:
      "Few places in the world carry the heavy burden of history as effortlessly as Kashi, or Varanasi, has. The holy city embodies the very soul of our civilization and personifies the resilience that we have displayed over centuries in the face of numerous adversities and fatal attacks. Waiting for Shiva: Unearthing the Truth of Kashi’s Gyan Vapi recreates the history, antiquity and sanctity of Kashi as the abode of Bhagwan Shiva in the form of Vishweshwara, or Vishwanath. Shiva himself assured his devotees of salvation if they leave their mortal coils in the city. The book delves into the history of this selfmanifested swayambhu jyotirlinga shrine of Vishweshwara, which for centuries has been both a refuge for the devout and a target of the bloodiest waves of iconoclasm. However, each time an attempt was made to obliterate the temple by demolishing it, it managed to rise and prosper. Every iconoclastic storm was followed by an episode of persistence, tenacity and stubborn resolve. Shrines fell and shrines rose, but the Hindus of Kashi never gave up—not even once. Waiting for Shiva documents these cataclysmic events in the temple’s history. The final death blow was dealt in 1669 by the Mughal despot Aurangzeb, who demolished the temple and erected few domes on the partially destroyed western wall to call it a mosque. The temple complex was desecrated and left strewn with ruins as a grim reminder of the humiliation and insult that Hindus had to face as a consequence of their holiest shrine being torn down to smithereens. The area that is now called the Gyan Vapi mosque and the surrounding land that lies adjacent to the new temple of Vishwanath, which came up towards the end of the 18th Century, has always been one of intense contestation. Bloody riots overran Varanasi over this issue multiple times in the past. During the colonial era, the doors of the British courts were knocked at to settle the occupancy issue, and they adjudicated the matter several times. PostIndependence, too, the desire to ‘liberate’ the complex has been seething in the Hindu imagination. A new suit filed in 2021 before the Varanasi civil court reopened a longfestering historical wound. Despite several appeals right up to the Supreme Court to dismiss the plaint, a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was ordered, which would lay bare the truth in its findings by the end of 2023. Vikram Sampath’s latest offering retraces the long history of this bitterly disputed site and the dramatic twists and turns in the checkered past of this hoary shrine. Piecing together numerous documents and accounts—Vedic and Puranic texts, Sanskrit literary sources, Agama shastras, Jataka tales, Persian accounts, travelogues of foreigners, archival records and copious legal documents detailing the contestation from the British era to modern Indian courts—the book recreates, for the first time with facts and cogent arguments, this stormy history right up to the present times. The longsuppressed secrets that lay hidden in Gyan Vapi finally finds a voice through this book.",

      "Snakes in the Ganga unveils uncomfortable truths concerning India’s vulnerabilities: Intense warfare against India’s integrity is the work of a wellorchestrated global machinery driven by a new ideology. Marxism has been reincarnated as critical race theory in US academia and serves as the framework to address America’s racism. This has been recklessly mapped on to India: Caste is equated with Race. Marginalized communities of India are considered as Blacks and Brahmins as the Whites of India. Groups claiming grievances (like Muslims and LGBTQ+) are artificially clubbed together. Popularly called the woke movement, the mission is to dismantle Indian civilization and heritage by waging an uncompromising war against India’s government, educational institutions, culture, industry, and society. Harvard University is ground zero of these social theories developed in collaboration with Indian scholars, activists, journalists, and artists. This represents a clear and present danger to India’s sovereignty and national security. Several Indian elites are hoisting Harvard as the vishwa guru with their money and family names. Some private universities within India are importing wokeism that has serious repercussions for India’s stability. Indian corporates are bringing the latest Western rubric of environmental, social, and governance ratings into their workplaces. This is aligned with the global social justice movement. China has exploited this latest infrastructure as a passage to India. Wokeism has penetrated some of the Indian government’s policies. For instance, the National Education Policy 2020 is propagating Harvard’s liberal arts. An entire ecosystem of ideologies, institutions, and young leaders is emerging for the recolonization of India. Is India for sale?",

      "Modian Consensus: The Rediscovery of Bharat maps the Indian political trajectory of the last 150 years. It locates various periods of consensus that developed in Bharat from time to time and drove the policy, planning and politics of the day. Four of these consensus phases of the past have been identified as Civilisational Consensus, Gandhian Consensus, Nehruvian Consensus and Secular Consensus. The fifth and ongoing phase, the book argues, is Modian Consensus. The book examines how the politics of the day finds itself willy-nilly amidst a consensus around the politics of Narendra Modi. In the current phase, parties and politicians diametrically opposed to Modis ideas are compelled to follow the line of policies and programmes set by him. The impact of this consensus can be observed far beyond the domain of politics as it stands on the three postulates of cultural rootedness, assertive nationalism and welfare for all. The book explores various manifestations of Modian Consensus, including the challenges it faces and what it augurs for the future of Indian politics.",

      "Invaders and Infidels: From Sindh to Delhi: The 500-Year Journey of Islamic Invasions is a work of gripping history, which tells the story of the origins and trajectory of Islamic invasions into India. It begins with the first Muslim conquest and ends with Babur’s invasion of Hindustan, spanning the period of the Delhi Sultanate which was in power for almost 320 years. This epochal story encompasses a vast sweep of events, which changed the history of India forever, and introduced it to an alien faith and a religious despotism such as the country had never experienced before. It comprises major and minor sagas of great heroism, untold savagery, stout resistance, brutal intrigues and epic tragedies. Embedded in this narrative are two major themes, largely overlooked in the inherited Indian historical and cultural memory. For more than three hundred years, alien Muslim invasions into India were largely fleeting, transitory and unstable. However, the lasting legacy of these Muslim invasions is the permanent destruction and disappearance of Classical India. Invaders and Infidels will fascinate anyone interested in the story of pre-Medieval India, a gateway era in the history of this ancient culture and civilisation.",

    about_book:
      "Nastik chronicles the transformative journey of a modern Indian sceptic who initially embraced Western neo-atheism. It begins with the protagonist’s disillusionment with religious dogma and his subsequent adoption of Western neo-atheism, characterized by a staunch denial of theism and a critique of religion’s influence on society. As the narrative unfolds, he encounters the rich tapestry of Indian philosophy. He discovers the nuanced perspectives of nastik schools of thought in Indian tradition, such as Charvaka, Jainism and certain interpretations of Buddhism, which reject the authority of the Vedas and the existence of a creator god yet engage deeply with ethical and philosophical questions. His transformation into a nastik and Nirishvarwaadi is marked by an appreciation for the complexity of Eastern scepticism, which often intertwines with spiritual and moral considerations unlike the more direct and often materialistic scepticism prevalent in the West. The book delves into the differences between Western and Eastern scepticism, highlighting how Eastern traditions offer a nuanced view that accommodates doubt within a spiritual framework. As his worldview evolves, he critiques the emergence of neo-atheism’s successor, ‘wokeism’, which he argues marks a shift from scepticism to a new form of dogmatism. He argues that neo-atheism inadvertently paved the way for wokeism by undermining traditional structures without offering a sustainable alternative, leading to a vacuum that wokeism has filled with its own set of moral certainties. At the penultimate stage, the protagonist explores the concept of Hindu scepticism, which is considered part of the broader Hindu tradition. The inclusiveness of this tradition highlights the unique ability of dharma to absorb various strands of thought. As the narration closes, he learns that at the heart of dharmic traditions lies a commitment to mutual respect, reciprocity and ahimsa (non-violence), which have allowed for a diverse array of beliefs and practices to coexist and flourish within the Indian philosophical landscape.",

      "दुनिया में कुछ ही ऐसी जगहें हैं जो इतनी सहजता से इतिहास का भार वहन कर पाती हैं, जितना काशी या वाराणसी ने किया है। यह पवित्र शहर हमारी सभ्यता की आत्मा का प्रतीक है और उस लचीलेपन का प्रतीक है जो हमने सदियों से कई प्रतिकूलताओं और घातक हमलों का सामना करते हुए प्रदर्शित किया है।‘प्रतीक्षा शिव की: ज्ञान वापी काशी के सत्य का उद्घाटन’ विश्वेश्वर या विश्वनाथ रूपी भगवान शिव की निवास स्थली के रूप में काशी के इतिहास, प्राचीनता और पवित्रता को पुनः प्रस्तु करती है। शिव ने स्वयं अपने भक्तों को आश्वासन दिया था कि यदि वे अपनी नश्वर कुण्डली का इस शहर में करेंगे तो उन्हें मोक्ष प्राप्त होगा। यह पुस्तक विश्वेश्वर के इस स्वयं-प्रकट स्वयंभू ज्योतिर्लिंग मंदिर के इतिहास पर प्रकाश डालती है, जो सदियों से भक्तों के लिए शरणस्थली भी रही है और मूर्तिभंजन की रक्तरंजित लहरों का लक्ष्य भी रही है। हालाँकि, जब भी मंदिर को ध्वस्त कर उसे नष्ट करने का प्रयास किया गया, यह और भी तीव्र उत्थान तथा वैभव के साथ लोकजीवन के समक्ष प्रकट हुआ। यह पुस्तक मंदिर के इतिहास में घटित इन प्रलयकारी घटनाओं का दस्तावेजीकरण करती है। मंदिर को अंतिम आघात 1669 में मुगल शासक औरंगज़ेब द्वारा दिया गया, जिसने मंदिर को खंडित कर, इसे मस्जिद कहे जाने के लिए आंशिक रूप से नष्ट हुई पश्चिमी दीवार पर कुछ गुंबद खड़े कर दिए। वह क्षेत्र जिसे अब ज्ञान वापी मस्जिद कहा जाता है और आसपास की भूमि जो कि विश्वनाथ के नए मंदिर के निकट स्थित है, 18वीं शताब्दी के अंत में बनी थी तथा यह हमेशा से तीव्र विवाद का विषय रही है। इस मुद्दे को लेकर वाराणसी में पहले भी कई बार खूनी दंगे हो चुके हैं। औपनिवेशिक युग के दौरान, क़ब्ज़े के मुद्दे को निपटाने के लिए ब्रिटिश अदालतों के दरवाजे खटखटाए गए और उन्होंने कई बार इस मामले पर अपना निर्णय भी दिया। स्वतंत्रता के बाद भी, इस परिसर को 'मुक्त' कराने की इच्छा हिंदू मन-मानस में पनपती रही है। ऐसे में वाराणसी सिविल कोर्ट के समक्ष 2021 में दायर एक नए मुकदमे ने लंबे समय से चले आ रहे ऐतिहासिक घाव को फिर से हरा कर दिया। याचिका को खारिज करने के लिए सुप्रीम कोर्ट में कई अपीलों के बावजूद, भारतीय पुरातत्व सर्वेक्षण (एएसआई) को इस परिसर के सर्वेक्षण का आदेश दिया गया, जिसने जनवरी 2024 में अपने निष्कर्षों के माध्यम से सच्चाई को उजागर किया। विक्रम संपत की यह नवीनतम पेशकश इस विवादित स्थल के लंबे इतिहास और इस प्राचीन मंदिर के विचित्र अतीत में आए नाटकीय मोड़ और बदलावों की याद दिलाती है। ज्ञानवापी में लंबे समय से दबे हुए रहस्यों को अंततः इस पुस्तक के माध्यम से आवाज मिलती है।",

      "कहानी संग्रह के रूप में प्रस्तुत ‘देवदूत’ ऐसी सच्ची घटनाओं का संग्रह है जिनमें जीवन से निराश व हताश लोगों के जीवन में एक अप्रत्याशित मोड़ आता है और किसी व्यक्ति के सहयोग से उनका नारकीय व दुखद जीवन सुख की लालिमा को देखने लगता है। देवदूत की कहानियों में वे ही घटनाएं चित्रित की गई हैं जो उन पात्रों से साक्षात्कार करते समय मुझे बतलाई गईं। इन कहानियों को खोजते हुए मैंने मानव विषाद व वंचनाओं को अति निकट से देखा एवं मेरी लेखनी ने उन सभी मार्मिक अनुभवों को एक क्रम में सजाने की कोशिश की है। देवदूत में एक ऐसे ही व्यक्ति के जनकल्याणकारी कार्यों का वर्णन है, जिनसे पीड़ितों व उपेक्षित लोगों को उनके बुरे समय में इलाज, वित्तीय सहायता, सम्मान, सुरक्षा, भोजन, वस्त्र, योजनाओं का लाभ आदि प्राप्त हुई और उनके जीवन का विषाद अचानक से कम हो गया। जैसे-जैसे आप इस पुस्तक के पन्नों में चित्रित उन सच्ची घटनाओं को पढ़ेंगे, वैसे-वैसे आपको उन पीड़ितों की पीड़ा और उनकी पीड़ा को हरने के लिए उनके जीवन में आये देवदूत के जनपरोपकारी कार्यों के बारे में पता चलेगा।",

    about_book:
      "‘Justice delayed is justice denied’ is a legal maxim that is often used to buttress the need for speedy justice. But what do we make of justice if it is served to a humble postman accused of stealing 57 rupees and 60 paise or a poor bus conductor charged with siphoning off 5 paise after legal battles that lasted for 29 years and 41 years, respectively? What do we make of justice if it costs so much that a retired senior bureaucrat and a senior Supreme Court judge say that they cannot afford the cost of litigation? What comes closest to this idea of manifest injustice is ‘justice delayed’ and ‘unequal access to justice’. There are various impediments and roadblocks to the dispensation of justice that can be termed as fair. Many of them are beyond the control of the judiciary itself. But a Bharat envisioning to become developed by 2047 needs to have a judiciary enabled by technology, guided by integrity, and motivated to provide quick relief. Piled-up case files, vacant judicial positions, and crumbling spaces cannot be the hallmark of a ‘nation on the move’. To clear these impediments, a concerted effort is required from all the stakeholders starting from government to litigants to the bar and the bench. The judiciary needs to be sophisticated and driven by the zeitgeist of high productivity, and judges need to have modern courtrooms so they can deliver justice swiftly. Stalled Wheels of Justice is not a commentary on law. That is something best left to jurists, lawyers, and constitutional experts. This is the story of law not being able to transform into justice. This is the story of denied insaaf and delayed nyaya. This is the story of a process that the author witnessed as a court reporter—a process that former chief justice of India N.V. Ramana equated with punishment. When the process itself becomes the punishment, poor justice-seekers become the first victims. Even when relief and judgments come forth, they are often empty of substance for they are pyrrhic victories. Much has been said and written from the points of view of persons in black robes, university professors, and intellectuals. But what about from men and women of the country who bore the heavy burden of injustice? This is the story of a faulty process, solvable unsolved problems, and, above all, of people at the end of the spectrum.",

    about_book:
      "The word ‘Bangaliyana’ roughly means ‘the Bengali way of life’. Bangaliyana, the book, is a delightful look at the author’s experience of life through his doodles and cartoons. Each page is infused with the vibrant spirit of Bengali culture, cuisine, and language from the author’spoint of view. Being a probashi Bengali, the author straddles the ‘native’ and the ‘cosmopolitan’ effortlessly and shares a unique perspective of the intersection by blending personal anecdotes with humour. The heart of the book beats with humour because of a delightful medley of doodles and cartoons. Over the span of the last decade, the author, a self-taught cartoonist, dedicated most of his weekends cartooning. Among numerous cartoons he created during this period, his exploration of Bengalis and Bangaliyana filled one of his sketchbooks up to the brim. It was within those pages that the seed of inspiration for this book took roots. The book defies being pigeonholed into a single genre. It is part memoir and part short story/humour. While everyday situations have provided a rich repository of ideas for the sketches, the book also captures moments of nostalgia from the author’s growing-up years. It allowed him to dig deep into his memory bank to fish out stories that most probashis will instantly relate to. Bangaliyana is not a critique of Bangla or Bengali culture but a tribute to the spirit of a true-blue Bengali. Whether you are a probashi or simply curious about the Bengali way of life, this book promises a heartfelt laugh.",

    about_book:
      "How often have you been advised to follow the teachings of Krishna but wondered what those teachings were? Krishna-Niti: Timeless Strategic Wisdom brings forth eleven of the most important lessons delivered by Krishna at critical junctures in the Mahabharata. These practical lessons are different from the spiritual wisdom imparted to Arjuna in the celebrated Bhagavad- Gita. Whether negotiating for peace between the Kauravas and Pandavas, resolving internal conflicts in the Pandava camp, or inspiring Yudhishthira to rule as a Dharmaraja (righteous ruler) at the end of the Kuruskshetra war, Krishna emerges as the strategist par excellence, who is as worldly wise as he is spiritually enlightened. Krishna’s instructions cover a wide range of subjects, including ethics, strategy, governance, policy, and above all dharma. However, throughout its wide scope, Krishna-Niti is governed by an underlying worldview, which can be summarised as jnana-karma-samuchchaya, or the right combination of knowledge and action to achieve the fourfold goals of human life. Krishna argues that karma is essential to life and natural order. Steadfastness in one’s karma is the key to the attainment of one’s goals whether material or spiritual. Escapism or inaction is not an option, neither is indecisiveness stemming from unending intellectual debates. In no case should one abandon one’s duty by citing a lack of good options. Krishna’s role in the Mahabharata is not just as a knower of dharma (dharmajna) but as its upholder and institutor (dharma-samsthapaka). Therefore, unlike other great works on niti, Krishna’s instructions are not theoretical but have an immediate relation to the situation at hand. His guidance is always delivered to a particular character in the epic, especially in moments of crisis, internal dissension, or war. This implies that we get to see the principles of Krishna-Niti in action throughout the epic. The authors, Kushagra Aniket and Nityananda Misra, draw upon their extensive research into the Mahabharata to present a unique gem of Nitishastra that is distilled from the quintessential Itihasa of India. They analyse Krishna’s practical wisdom through his interventions on numerous occasions. Rooted in the vision of the epic, Krishna-Niti: Timeless Strategic Wisdom paints the authentic picture of Krishna as a statesman— an enduring image that is deeply relevant to our times.",

    about_book:
      "Whispers from the Past is an overture to the history and culture of classical Kashmir, which for over a thousand years was one of the most creative places in the world. Through the book, the author hopes to acquaint the reader with Kashmir’s contributions to art and aesthetics, including drama, music, painting, sculpture, sciences, yoga, tantra, literature, and philosophy. The region’s culture was premised on the idea that universal consciousness binds humanity together, and knowing this at the individual’s level is fundamental to self-understanding and for creative growth. Classical Kashmiri artists appreciated great art not merely from its inherent cleverness points of view but for its capacity to inspire audiences to the source of creativity itself, and this entailed devotion to excellence and a robust tradition of criticism. The book explores the currents of intellectual life and the lives of prominent royals, writers, and sages, showing how Kashmiri scholars and travellers came to influence not only southern regions but also far-away lands beyond the Himalayas. It showcases Kashmir’s famed storytelling tradition through abridged tales from the Panchatantra, Kathā-sarit-sāgara, and Yoga Vāsiṣṭha, the last of which is arguably the greatest book of imagination and wisdom ever written on the conundrums of consciousness with unequalled clarity. Kashmiri aesthetics and the search for meaning in life resonate with modern sensibility",

    about_book:
      "Kashi: The Valiant History of a Sacred Geography tells the story of the most sacred of all Hindu holy cities through the prism of sacred geography as is extensively documented in the Sthala Purana. The book features a summary of the Kashi Khanda from the Skanda Purana, an ancient text on the divine origin and leela surrounding the kshetra of Kashi. The history of this kshetra is enriched by the accounts of warrior sadhus, sages, kings, queens, devotees and ordinary citizens who dedicated their lives to preserving and reviving this sacred geography by doggedly building and rebuilding temples, taking up arms against invaders, meticulously documenting Kashi’s history and lore, and tenaciously sustaining pilgrimage routes and practices covering the holy sites of this pivotal city. In particular, the lesser-known story of the warrior sadhus who defended the Kashi Vishwanath temple from marauding invaders is explored through the lens of sacred geography. Studied in this light, Kashi is both a spatial and metaphysical contestation. The current controversy and litigation over the Gyanvapi site cannot therefore be satisfactorily resolved without taking recourse to the idea of sacred geography, which has since time immemorial informed Hindus and indigenous societies worldwide about their identity and the relevance of space and place, culture and metaphysics, civilization and the development of nationhood.",

The author picked some of contemporary’s most contentious topics, such as global warming, scientific marvels, the mysteries of life and the universe, cultural and religious superstitions, illusions and prejudices in the practise of science, and the importance of religion in society, and dissected them one by one with a rationalist knife. So what his writings essentially do is show a mirror to society. By being both accessible and arresting at once, the book deserves a place in everyone’s library",

      "The Indosphere is a broad, expansive cultural and geographical category under the influence of ancient India. While India’s cultural reach beyond the subcontinent has a storied past, its relationship with Cambodia is all but forgotten. Shared Roots tries to plug that gap. Embark on a captivating odyssey through the vibrant currents that once flowed freely between India and Cambodia. Woven together by the threads of dharma, the Indosphere is a fascinating realm where kings exchanged not just spices but also ideas, where artists found inspiration in shared mythology and where spirituality transcended borders. In this collection, seven authors from diverse fields meticulously plot the textures of this bilateral history, revealing the profound connection that shaped both the nations. From the echoing verses of the Reamker to the breathtaking grandeur of Angkor Wat, each page unveils the enduring legacy of this ancient bond. But Shared Roots is more than just a historical journey. It is an invitation to rediscover the power and beauty of cultural exchange untainted by colonialism, a potent reminder that diversity is not just a feature but also an essential building block of a just society. Drawing upon meticulous research and captivating storytelling, this book ignites a conversation about civilizational revival, urging us to celebrate the past while embracing a future enriched by shared understanding. The book is a stunning exploration of cultural fusion, a testament to the enduring power of enlightened values, and a call to action for a more vibrant world.",

    about_book:
      "Reclaiming Bharatavarsha is a collection of topical and exploratory essays organized around three broad themes. The first explores various facets of classical Bharatavarsha, which is defined as India before the advent of alien Islamic invaders and British colonisation. The second delves into the condition of an India under successive alien regimes. The impact of these regimes on our culture and society is contrasted with the conditions prevailing in the preceding classical era. The third studies the imprint of these bouts of foreign rule on contemporary national life. The three themes taken separately are complementary, and together they offer a scope for comparative analyses of the politics, culture, society, customs, and literature of different eras in the life of this ancient land. From selected episodes drawn from the Puranas and the Mahabharata to the sacred history of the banana, from the 17th-century Bengali arrack to woke cinema, from the 1962 war with China to hair dyes, the book offers an eclectic mix of atypical essays, the narratives of which are filled with rare anecdotes and vivid details, all of which are backed by scholarly research. The book also has a contemporary context—the unprecedented transformation of India over the last decade. A major outcome of this transformation is the surge in interest for recovering India’s national and civilizational past. This collective resurgence is an expression of cultural self-confidence, which had fallen by the wayside for centuries. Reclaiming Bharatavarsha is a humble addition to this national endeavour.",

This book fearlessly dismantles prevalent misconceptions about nature, history, and ancient civilizations propagated by modern media while debunking Hinduphobic myths surrounding Aryans, invasions, and ritual practices. Through this critique, Rearming Hinduism draws connections between Hinduphobia and a culture marked by exploitation and self-destruction, suggesting that a revitalized Hindu perspective may offer a potent counterforce. It urges readers to envision the present through the lens of timeless principles, thereby uplifting our understanding of our land, time, and the enduring values of sanatana dharma.",

      "Tathagata Roy was born in 1945 in Kolkata into a humble middle-class East Bengali Hindu family. Even as a student, he was brilliant at observing life around him, which has found expression in this book. Roy is something of a polymath. He began life as a civil engineer, joined the Indian railways and played a significant role in building India’s first Metro in Kolkata. He then branched off into law, enquiring into the intersection of law and engineering, the subject he taught at Jadavpur University. He later joined politics and worked to build up the BJP in his home state West Bengal. In 2015 he was appointed the governor of Tripura, and later also of Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Roy has authored a book on the exodus of Hindus from the erstwhile East Pakistan and Bangladesh, which he later translated into Bengali. He has also written a biography of Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder of Bharatiya Jan Sangh, which is the forerunner of today’s BJP. He has five books to his credit—two in English and three in Bengali. Roy is widely travelled and has done considerable trekking in the Himalayas, including to places of pilgrimage such as Mount Kailash. He is married with two daughters, both married, and has lived most of his life in Kolkata.",
    about_book:
      "Desires, Dreams and Powers is a fascinating saga of the life and times of Tathagata Roy. Not many people may have traipsed into so many fields of life as Roy has. He has been a civil engineer, an encyclopaedic, a university teacher, a researcher, a contract lawyer, a politician, an author in two languages, an intrepid traveller and, lately, a history buff. By writing about his times than his life, Roy covers truly eventful eight decades of a nation in transition, during which British rule transmogrified into the partitions of India and Bengal, the world around him transformed from writing with a quill pen to taming the personal computer and toying with AI, and politics from optimism to Naxalism to hope. His native West Bengal, the crucible of left ideology, finally exorcised the ghost of Marxism by overthrowing the Left Front united in 2011 after 34 years of unbroken communist rule. Through it all, he pranced into high school, segued into engineering college, got his first job with the Indian railways, taught at Jadavpur University, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party and capped it all up by becoming the governor of three north-eastern states of India. The book is as much about the trajectory of a nation on the move as it is about Roy’s life. The parallel is unmissable.",

      "The Collector’s Mother is a story of grit and perseverance. An ‘unwanted’ woman from an underprivileged background is attacked and, along with her husband, dragged on the village road and humiliated, and the family’s land grabbed by a local land mafia. In the godforsaken village deep into the hinterland, such excesses are not uncommon, but her steely resolve makes her stand out. How she weathers through such soul-sapping encounters to beat all odds and inspires her son to become a collector is at the heart of this extraordinary story set against the backdrop of abject caste oppression, absence of rule of law, persistent traditional power structure, pitiable education system, food insecurity, drought, famine, lack of health care and communication, hatred and domination by fellow villagers.",

He pursued his dream of clearing one of the toughest exams in the world alongside working a full-time job. He cleared the exam in 2014 and was allotted the Indian Revenue Service. Since then, he has worked in different sections of the income-tax department. His passion for learning went beyond job security. Rather than resting on his laurels, he studied law and earned LLB and LLM degrees from Gujarat National Law University, Gandhinagar. While preparing for CSE, Shakti realised the lack of good guidance for students preparing for the exam. How To Get into IAS is a direct result of that longstanding need. The book is a one-stop guide for all civil service aspirants. Rohit Sharma is a bestselling author with five published books to his credit. He is currently working with one of the world’s leading IT companies and has over eighteen years of industry experience. He has a master’s degree in IT and a bachelor’s degree with gold medal in computer engineering. Rohit is also a motivational speaker; he has delivered lectures in various colleges and universities across India. In his free time, he coaches students for various competitive examinations. That’s when he realized there wasn’t a book on information related to CSE and got together with Shakti Singh. It took them six years of extensive research and hard work to complete How to Get into IAS. It is a complete guide for all UPSC aspirants. Rohit is a proud pet parent to an indie named Rocky. He dreams of opening a shelter home for stray animals someday. Meanwhile, a major percentage of the earnings from the book will go into providing for the wellbeing of our homeless paw stars.",

    about_book:
      "History writing, especially of the subcontinent during the colonial era, is filled with preconception and misconception. Colonial historiography stripped Hinduism of its Hindu-ness and India of Bharat. Colonial historicity, according to the author, is merely descriptive and random interpretations of myths rather than engaging with the idea of mythmaking. Decolonizing Hinduism is an attempt to address that. In the book, the author places ecology, astronomy and timescale (yuga cycle) at the heart of the Hindu belief system. These important dimensions of Hinduism are not taught in our history classes. Instead, perceptions about Hinduism are limited to polytheism, idol worship and caste system. The book tries to rescue Hinduism from these biases and give voice to a uniquely indigenous version of Hinduism. He does so by demystifying the deeper concepts of Hinduism and history with allegories drawn from modern technological innovation in the field of capitalist economy, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, block chain, etc., to make them interesting.",

Known for challenging the established wisdom in fields as diverse and inspiring as civilizations, cross-cultural encounters, co nsciou snes s, and a rtificial intelligence, he combines his life-journey as a technocrat, an entrepreneur, and spiritual explorer, formulating new frameworks and paradigms to bring ancient knowledge into the present context.

    about_book:
      "The Battle for Consciousness Theory: A Response to Ken Wilber's Appropriation of Sri Aurobindo's Work and Other Indian Thought is a compelling and meticulous account of the digestion and subversion of the work of one of India’s greatest sages—Sri Aurobindo. The book uncovers the systematic co-opting of Sri Aurobindo’s seminal ideas by the American theorist Ken Wilber and their reformulation into his own ‘Integral Theory’. Based on extensive research spanning a quarter century, the book provides deep insights into the developments that shaped (and distorted) the Aurobindonian discourse in recent decades. It discusses the ramifications of the enhancement of Western Universalism at the expense of Vedic and other Indian traditions while analyzing certain limitations in Wilber’s work.",

      "Being Hindu adopts a longue durée view of history and attempts to contextualize the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its progenitor, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), as political phenomena by examining certain medieval state structures and instances of advocacy and popular mobilization in the colonial period. Further, it studies the politics of Narendra Modi and the policy initiatives undertaken by him as the prime minister of India to highlight their apparent cultural and moral underpinnings. Its eventual objective is to make a case for the historical authenticity of the Hindu mode of politics that emerged in post-Independence India. The attempt, in other words, is to demonstrate that it is a thing in its own right and not a cynical invention of hostility towards religious minorities, an irrational or ‘fascist’ mindset, or sundry anxieties, but has precedents in frameworks and practices going rather far back in history. The BJS and the BJP are thus shown to be locatable in a long tradition of Hindus organizing their political practice or politics through cultural resources and a cultural imagination distinctive to them. Narendra Modi, similarly, brings an inclusive Hindu catholicity and sangathanist outlook to his politics and developmental agenda. Being Hindu, in this way, relates a brief history of the political expressions of being Hindu over slightly more than eleven centuries— from the ascension of Aditya I, the first of the imperial Cholas, in 870 CE until our own time and age.",

    about_book:
      "Spectacular advances in modern science and technology have made our lives more comfortable but not necessarily healthier or more peaceful. We are facing serious existential risks for nature and humanity where the developments are challenging our understanding. Genome to Om explores the desired transition from modern science to meta-science, blending ethical, moral, and spiritual insights while recognizing the interconnectedness of all aspects of life. It emphasizes a holistic scientific approach, talking of the marvels of science and technology, and the consequent perils that have engulfed all living beings and the planet itself. The authors pose intriguing questions about the wonders of the cosmos, life’s origin, and most of all, the goal and purpose of life’s journey. Genome represents the dynamic modern science, while Om embodies universal consciousness as the ultimate reality. This book is an endeavour to bridge the gap between empirical knowledge and higher-order wisdom, advocating an innovative, inclusive, technologically advanced, yet spiritually enriched and ethically grounded future. The daring proposal seeks the possibility of progressing from the Anthropocene to an ideal Omcene epoch. Genome to Om offers hope for the meaningful progression to a meta-society, and the onward journey towards harmony between scientific progress and timeless human values to reach our full potential seeking unity in diversity for universal peace and well-being, and to continue the journey of life, the Om Way.",

    about_book:
      "Since the 13th century, numerous European have travelled to India. Driven by a thirst for adventure or trade opportunities, they embarked on extraordinary voyages across the sea to India. Their journeys were fraught with obstacles, including attacks by marauding gangs and animals, exposure to harsh climates, treacherous terrain, and unknown tropical diseases. Nonetheless, the desire to explore India’s exotic and distant lands propelled them forward. Almost all of them kept meticulous journals of their travels, chronicling the course of Indian history. Crossing Continents explores the stories of several such travellers: Niccolao Manucci, William Hawkins, Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, Mark Twain, Athanasius Nikitin, Fanny Parkes, etc. All these travellers were relatively unknown at the time and were of little significance in their native homes. They were not bound by their rulers to report in a certain way, which was why their reports were largely unfiltered, unbiased, and unhindered. Each of them travelled to India with different objectives. One seeking precious gems while another a means to fend off debts. Others were driven purely by a desire to travel. They arrived in India during different periods and had unique stories to share. Their untiring pens stitched together a dispassionate history of India—a land of unfathomable contradictions—where sadhus meditated in high-mountain caves and merchants haggled in bustling markets.",

      "After the partition of Bengal in 1947, the influx of refugees from across the border created one of the world’s largest migration crises. In the early years after independence, Prime Minister Nehru imposed the Nehru–Liaquat Pact, an agreement with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, which did not serve India’s interests but instead helped Pakistan. In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi enacted the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The objective of the law is to confer citizenship to persecuted minorities, including Bengali Hindus. However, the Congress and communist parties opposed it. From Nehru to Modi sheds light on the struggles faced by Bengali Hindus in post-independent Pakistan. It exposes how the Congress under Nehru’s leadership failed these persecuted refugees. The book also highlights the role of Syama Prasad Mookerjee in advocating for a homeland for Bengali Hindus in West Bengal. The tenacious efforts of organizations such as the RSS, Bharatiya Jana Sangh, and later the BJP in demanding dignity, rehabilitation, and citizenship for these refugees are also explored in some detail.",

    about_book:
      "After nearly ten centuries of invasions and colonial rule, and seven decades after achieving a bloodied and partitioned freedom, the Indian nation-civilisation is experiencing a remarkable surge in nationalism. There is a strong urge to revive and assert itself politically, culturally, and economically. India, that is Bharat, is challenging its colonised mindset and manners, striving to write its own story and history, which were distorted by its colonisers and tormentors. India’s New Right captures this pivotal moment in Bharat’s life. The book seeks to understand this exceptional period in Bharat’s history through the eyes of the many protagonists driving this change. Some of these individuals are prominent public figures, while others are faceless individuals working behind the scenes to bring about change. The book features nearly fifty full-length interviews woven into the larger narrative. It covers a wide range of subjects, from youth to economy, history to popular culture, law to gender identity, minorities to ghar wapsi, and the demographic war.",

    about_book:
      "How India, a land of diverse ethnicities, religions, and languages, has managed to maintain its social cohesion and harmony for thousands of years? How has it managed the forces of social stratification, social exclusion, social stagnation, and social emancipation? Are the institutions of caste and untouchability, jathi and varna peculiar to India? Or is there some other deeper coda to Indian society that sustains it through millennia? This book explores these questions by tracing the origin and evolution of India’s social systems from the ancient Harappan civilization to the present day. It reveals the underlying principles, values, and worldviews that shaped India’s social dynamics and enabled it to adapt and thrive in changing times. It also highlights the role of Indian spiritual values, especially the concepts of yajna and bhakti, in fostering social inclusion and emancipation. Drawing on historical data from various Hindu traditions and biographical data of civilizational-spiritual seers, the book challenges the common perception of these seers as mere rebels or social reformers. Instead, it shows how they were agents of self-realisation who also energised the society to achieve social transformation.This book is not only a comprehensive and insightful account of India’s social history but also a valuable source of inspiration and guidance for anyone who seeks to create a more peaceful, harmonious, and prosperous world.",

    about_book:
      "India, or Bharat, is a land of unparalleled diversity, a true chitraayana where the tapestry of life is woven with vibrant maanyata (respect) and maryaada (dignity). This nation, with its timeless unity in multiplexity, is a testament to a culture of cultures bonded by a rich tradition of creativity and ingenuity. Padma Bharatis captures this essence through a collection of essays that spotlight the remarkable achievements of ordinary Indians. Over recent years, public recognition of these unsung heroes has witnessed a paradigm shift with Padma awardees increasingly representing the true diversity of the nation. The stories within this book highlight the strength and resilience of people who bring sustainable change while honouring their cultural traditions and experiential knowledge passed down through generations. They are earthy, real, and often from rustic or small- town backgrounds, embodying the core values of a civilization on its path to a sustainable and aspirational future. Padma Bharatis is a celebration of these incredible souls.",
