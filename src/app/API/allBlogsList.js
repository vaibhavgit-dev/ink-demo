      <h3>To understand the real Sanatan Dharma, its deeper philosophy and worldview, it is important first to understand what it is not…</h3>
      <p>Sanatan Dharma is not religion—this is the first thing we must resolutely bear in mind. It has never had an established clergy or a central authority, and there has never been any final arbiter in the interpretation or application of the Dharma, no single scripture or theology, no prescribed rites and rituals, and whatever rituals that do exist in the day-to-day living of the Dharma are highly symbolic in nature.</p>
      <p>The second important thing to remember is that Dharma has never been about mandatory or prescribed rules for ethical and religious behavior; it does not posit absolute rights or wrongs and holds that everything is relative and contextual and the sense of right and wrong must arise only from one’s inner understanding, guided by the higher buddhi or the Atman. Therefore, in Sanatan Dharma, the most important practice is to awaken and cultivate the atman and the buddhi of which spiritual discrimination—viveka—is an essential part.</p>
      <p>Sanatan Dharma does not tell us what to eat or not to eat, what to wear or not to wear, how to live and behave. It is not a set of dos and don’ts—for Sanatan Dharma, the only thing of spiritual, social, and moral significance is the development of consciousness: the height or depth of one’s consciousness is incomparably more significant than a set of moral and social rules and laws. In fact, of what good use would all our ethical and social rules be without any development of consciousness?</p>
      <p>We must also bear in mind that Sanatan Dharma is not just the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, or the Upanishads, nor the Mahabharata or the Ramayana, nor even the Puranas—these texts do not in any way define or limit the Dharma. However, these texts do align the buddhi to Dharma, making Dharma more accessible to the mind of humanity. A deep understanding of the Vedas, the Gita, and the Upanishads, for example, can be of immense importance to one who wishes to live the Dharmic life, but they are not the only sources or guides. The ultimate source of the Dharma, and the only infallible guide, is the eternal Wisdom within, the secret Veda in the heart. This is the only grand scripture and temple of Sanatan Dharma.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the finding of the Atman is the only fundamental and indispensable practice of Sanatan Dharma—all else is of secondary or peripheral interest.</p>

      "content": `
      <div class="blog-content">
      <p>One of the tools to do so, in my opinion, is the growing science of Modern Semiology. Granted that it is not one of the ancient Vedangas, one of the six modes or limbs to understand the Veda. But, in the spirit of exploration and adventure, which, I believe, was the approach and modus operandi of the ancient Rishis who ‘composed’ it and compiled it, we should try new methodologies and modes to help appreciate it. In the process, we may discover some new aspects of Veda in the modern language that the new generation or academia might relate to more readily.</p>
      <p>Let us look at what Modern Semiology says about some of the basics of how signs work, whether verbal, auditory, visual, even ritual or gesture. Ferdinand Saussure in the 19th Century, attempted to describe the dynamics of languages, symbols and communication and how it works. His lectures taken down by his pupils in the book, Course in Natural Linguistics, shed a new light on the way language and linguistics might be seen. In the process, he hit upon some insights which helped create a new science of Linguistics in the Western world and helped initiate the new disciplines and philosophies of Structuralism and Post-Structuralism.</p>
      <p>What did he say about language? He described language in several sets of binaries which we shall explore in the context of Veda and see how they configure and arrange themselves to the entirely different mind of the Rishis and their esoteric Riks. One of the first of these is what he called Langue and Parole.</p>
      <h4>Langue and Parole</h4>
      <p>Langue according to Saussure was the rules of language that are used by the population or community. It is an abstract order that consists of the conventions of language. These are the standards of communication that have evolved over time, which we learn when we are learning a language. He compared it to the rules of chess that we need to imbibe before we can play the game. Parole according to him was the individual articulate of the language, with its own idiosyncrasies and quirks.</p>
      <p>When we come to the Veda, we see a language complete in itself, with a shared symbolism across the entire compilation of its Riks. We have no other Literature in Vedic Sanskrit to compare it to from the time, since none is available. Interestingly, the entire rules of its phonology have been preserved for several millennia by extremely dedicated teachers and pupils, remarkably so, such that we know how it was pronounced in 1500 BCE and the individual words included in its composition known as the pada patha. This is a feat unheard of in the annals of human history.</p>
      <p>We do not know if Vedic Sanskrit was spoken also by the lay population or only by the Rishis and their esoteric circle. New research in the origin of Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages suggests that it may have originated more than 5500 years ago, putting it as an antecedent to the Indus Valley Civilization. Be that as it may, it seems likely that the Veda was studied only by those who had dedicated their life to it, so vast is its corpus, so intricate its rituals, and methods of training that have preserved it in pristine condition.</p>
      <p>We notice that within the system of its language, style of communication and consistent method of symbolism there is much individuality evinced by the individual Rishis, each with his or her own style of composition. Some like Vasishtha are lyrical, others like Vishvamitra are powerful, and yet others like Dirghatamas are profound and mysterious. There is thus a parole to the Langue of Veda. But it is possible that Vedic Sanskrit was a language within a language, restricted only to a select few, and in that case, it would be what in Semiologic parlance is called an Idiolect.</p>
      <p>But if we study complex systems of signs such as mass communications, we see not one but multiple subsidiary languages working as a compendium to give messages that may have subliminal, subtle, hidden qualities, even agendas. Veda is such a complex system since it incorporates multiple subsidiary languages such as word meaning, the sound of chanting or singing its verses, the symbolism of its visual elements, the performance of its rituals, and the entire poetic element of prosody, paronomasia and puns and the mantra which are one of its distinct qualities. And it is incumbent on any interpreter to take a holistic approach to this complexity of language rather than just describe its word-meanings taken at their most obvious interpretation.</p>
      <p>The Veda has been translated in modern times almost as if a movie critic saw a movie and described only its dialogs, missing out on its visual and auditory elements, the edition, the special effects, the subliminal narratives, the suspense and the buildup and the mystery. In the modern times, only Sri Aurobindo has pointed out these elements of Veda that are often missed by the interpreters, the resonance and reverberations of sound and the mantra, the symbolism that connects deeply with the phonemes or the sound-units, the shlesha alankara that gives multiple layers of meaning to the verses, and the spiritual and experiential element that is often missed by most. Our goal is to build up on the lines of exploration he opened up for the future generation of scholars and students.</p>
      <h4>The Signifier and The Signified</h4>
      <p>The signifier in modern Semiology is the indication in the sign and the signified is what is indicated. Both, according to Saussure, were concepts in the mind, terms that are articulated. In his understanding the relationship between the two is usually arbitrary, i.e., there is no reason for why a particular signifier should hint at a certain signified.    
      In Veda, the approach is different. The root sounds or moola dhvani of Vedic Sanskrit have each their own quality, hinting at what the sound means to the psychology of the one chanting or listening. Thus, the signified may be said to be inherent in the signified. For example, the sound ma- gives a sense of finality and completion and its impact is seen even today in the languages of today giving rise to families of words such as Mother, Mater, Matri, Mata, Mom, Matrix, etc., and Mrityu, Mortality, Muerto, etc.</p>
      <p>In Veda thus, the binary of Saussure collapses with this inherent unity of the Signifier and the Signified. Also, the mantra creates an inevitability of rhythm, vision and meaning, fused together in an intimate relationship, that the sound creates its own effect, sometimes independent or in association with the word-meaning. This creates a parallelism of languages as discussed in the previous section and this poetry which is untranslatable is often missed in almost all translations.</p>
      <h4>The Synchrony and the Diachrony</h4>
      <p>Synchrony is when one considers all elements of a language at a given point in time. Diachrony studies how it evolves over time. With Vedic Sanskrit, this is not possible since we not only do not have another work of literature in the language from that time as discussed earlier. Vedic Sanskrit is different from Classical Sanskrit in several ways.    
      Modern interpreters attempt to study the Veda using the hints given in its own verses since there are no external archeological or historical finds from that period available to us from that period. Thus, no outer indicators or corroborative evidence may be used to study the Veda.</p>
      <p>But it is my opinion that we can not only use the hints from the Veda itself but also study the evolution of its symbols, its experiential descriptions and its ‘model of the Universe’ along with its spirituality to at least gain some insight into how other human beings have responded to it. Granted, this interpretation of theirs may not be used to clinch the hidden meanings of Veda, but a study of semiology would be incomplete if we did not study the impact its signs and symbols have had on other humans along the millennia.</p>
      <h4>The Syntagmatic and Paradigmatic Structures</h4>
      <p>The syntagm is the structure of certain phrases or sentences in the work. Or, as Roland Barthes explains in Elements of Semiology, it is ‘a combination of signs…linear and irreversible (it is the spoken chain) …each linguistic unit is like a like a column in a building of antiquity: this column is in a real relation of contiguity with other parts of the building, for instance the architrave (syntagmatic relation).’ The paradigm goes deeper and wider to understand the entire scope of a work and is equivalent to the langue of Saussure. For example, ‘if the column is Doric, it evokes in us a comparison with other architectural orders, the Ionian or the Corinthian,’ in the words of Barthes. It may be worthwhile studying both with the Veda. The syntagm shows us certain motifs and phrases that recur in a fixed order, certain myths and messages that abound in varying degrees in a circular and spiral manner but with contiguous fixity, that create their own impact and help create the larger paradigm.</p>
      <p>The paradigm of the Veda is remarkable in that it consistently returns to the One Reality that underlies all existence and yet is so dynamic that it creates a multitude of worlds (seven at least) and emanations that may express its entire power in their forms that are yet eternally connected to their source, Tad Ekam, and each other. The paradigm helps compare it with other darshanas, theologies, philosophes, worldviews, etc. Thus, the Veda is neither monotheistic the way we understand the term in Abrahamic religions with an external God floating in the atmosphere, giving out citations and meting out punishments for a putative afterlife. Nor is it polytheistic the way Greek or Roman mythology is presently interpreted. Nor is it monistic if we use a term supplied by a Spinozean metaphysics. It is all of these and yet much more, its unity so compact that it can brook an infinite multiplicity and utter freedom to each.</p>
      <p>Veda is deeply symbolic, with each ritual, recitation, audition, enactment, and performance, a multi-media event (humanity’s first!). But its symbol is not separate from the Real for its goal is not an abstract signified but a unitary consciousness where there is no separation between the object and the subject, the signifier and the signified. In other words, the Symbol is the Real in Veda and the Real is the Symbol. Every act or human endeavor is imbued with profound reverence and mystery, with significance that is not only personal but also universal. For the individual is not separate from the cosmic, the deva is not apart from the human. The entire Vedic system of symbology is unique in the annals of human history, that makes it extremely difficult for the modern mind to comprehend, as we discussed initially.</p>
      <p>And yet, in a strange way, it helps us return to our own subconscious or collective unconscious, as Jung might have noted. Or to take a Vedantic signifier, it takes us back to ourselves, once we strip away all the layers of mental encrustations we have grown in our life and recover a primal, elemental and innocent way of seeing and perceiving. In any case, it is a document of humanity’s first exploration into the meaning of Life and Death, Truth and Falsehood, Light and Darkness, Bliss and Suffering. And it is a record of how our ancients broke through into an understanding that helped them reconcile these dualities and how they expressed and communicated it to the generations to come, with a clear awareness of how their way of perceiving might be lost.</p>
      <h4>Denotation and Connotation</h4>
      <p>In Semiology, to denote means to give a straightforward literal meaning. For example, a rose is a flower, or blue is color. To connote means to hint at subtler or hidden layers of understanding, creating a secondary order of language. Thus, the rose might connote passion and blue sadness. Again, more interpreters in translating the Veda focus on the denotation and miss out on the connotation. And they create a physical literal rendering missing out on the hidden significances, the subtle hints and indications of a deeper life.</p>
      <p>According to Roland Barthes in Elements of Semiology, the plane of connotation is ‘wider’ than the plane of denotation. Or rather, the denoting system becomes a mere element of the connoting system, Or the first system of denotation becomes a signifier to the second system of connotation. We see this happen throughout the Veda with its multiple layers of meaning. TV Kapali Sastry. In Lights on the Veda, has quoted an ancient Puranic phrase, trayortha sarva vedeshu, i.e., there are three layers of meaning throughout the entire Veda. Swami Dayananda has shown in his Rig Veda Bhasha Bhashya that the use of shlesha alankara or the pun or Paronomasia is used extensively in the Veda creating not only layers of sense but also multiple visual and symbolic metaphors and similes. Sri Aurobindo explains in Hymns to the Mystic Fire that the use of these multiple layers of meaning is not intellectual or cognitive alone but also experiential and spiritual.</p>
      <p>But the Veda gives us not only multiple planes of connotation but also a metalanguage. Tatyana Elizarenkova in Language and Style of the Vedic Rsis shows that there is not only an intentional approach to create multiple connotations but also that the Vedic Rishis were highly aware of their methods, using varied techniques like Polysemy, Synonymy, Morphology, Vocabulary, Prosody, Syntax and ‘sound-painting.’</p>
      <p>A metalanguage is a language that describes language. The Vedic Rishis were highly conscious practitioners of their art. And they often commented about their own verse in the Rig Veda. For example, they note that their verse is a secret expression, ninya vacamsi, and that only a seer could understand their seer-verse. What a mantra can do is sometimes discussed in the mantra itself describing its own effect. In Rig Veda I.2.3, Vayu Deva grants the power in the mantra that helps establish it in the subtle body of the spiritual aspirant. In the terms of Semiology, the object language, or the ordinary language that is used to describe things or objects in the world, is described by the metalanguage. Or, as Roland Barthes notes in Elements of Semiology, ‘a metalanguage is a system whose plane of content is itself constituted by a signifying system; or else, it is a semiotics which treats of a semiotics.’</p>
      <p>Perhaps, the Veda is a first literature which contains within itself a partial metalanguage that describes its own language. This awareness of oneself and one’s own craft, its artefactual nature and literariness, is seen in modern times as metafiction. While the Veda is not metafiction per se, it evinces the self-awareness, the sense of exhilaration and the mastery of the craft in its verse that tells us of the very refined culture of its practitioners.</p>
      <p>We can say in this short review that Modern Semiology gives us another way to apprehend or at least approach this mighty compendium or Samhita of our shared ancestry that has had a profound impact on human religions, philosophies and literatures. Further investigations may be attempted in the author’s opinion to help us explore its mysteries using a modern idiom but with empathy to an ancient vision and way of seeing and feeling.</p>
      <p>But we must note one caveat: the limitation of semiology is that it is a language about another language, be it sign-language, sound-language or word-language. But Veda moves from language to experience, from symbol to a state of awareness, from ritual to sacredness, from individuality to universality, from sound to mystery, from figures of speech to unity and a worldview.</p>
      <p>As long as we are aware of this difference between semiology and the true intent and accomplishment of Veda, we can perhaps look toward a new approach to studying the Veda and semiology itself. This might not only transform our understanding of these ancient hymns but of the science of signs that itself is rapidly evolving.    
      Can a symbol transform the beholder? This is the question the Veda poses us. If we understand this, its riks get metamorphosed from regular verse to poetry of a different order, describing experiences and realizations in a language unique and supra-normal to our daily cognition, showing us how semiology has the power to effect a transmutation and radical shift in consciousness. A new order for semiology itself.</p>

      <h3>2024 के चुनाव राजनीति और राजनैतिक दलों से कहीं आगे जाएंगे। इस बार दांव बहुत ऊँचे हैं। इस विषय में हमें कोई भ्रम नहीं होना चाहिए—यदि श्री नरेंद्र मोदी की सरकार स्पष्ट बहुमत के साथ वापस नहीं आती हैं, हम भारत के लिए यह युद्ध I.N.D.I.A और वैश्विक वोक (Woke) वादिओं से हार सकते हैं।</h3>
      <p>सनातन धर्म पर होने वाले आक्रमणों का एक कारण—निस्संदेह, सोच समझ कर की गयी शैतानी और राजनैतिक लाभ के अलावा—यह है कि वास्तव में अधिकांश लोग जो इसकी आलोचना करते हैं और इस पर आक्रमण करते हैं, इसके बारे में बहुत कम जानते या समझते हैं। और यह, दुर्भाग्य से, उन कई लोगों पर समान रूप से लागू होता है जो इसका बचाव करना चाहते हैं। इसीलिए, सनातन धर्म के इर्द-गिर्द होने वाली अधिकांश सार्वजनिक चर्चा राजनैतिक एवं भावनाओं से भरे शोर के नीचे दब गई है। आवश्यकता है सभी सम्मानजनक मंचों और स्थानों पर धर्म के विषय में तर्कसंगत और ज्ञानपूर्ण बहस की—यह अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण आवश्यकता है, क्योंकि सनातन धर्म भारतीय सभ्यता के स्वभाव और चरित्र को परिभाषित करता है एवं आकार देता है। यह ऐसा विषय नहीं है जिसे कि सहजता से लिया जाये या फिर राजनैतिक शोर समझ कर छोड़ दिया जाये।</p>
      <p>हम में से वह लोग जो की अपने वैदिक पूर्वजों के सनातन धर्म को जानते या समझते है —जिसे मैंने वेदों और उपनिषदों का सनातन धर्म कहा है—उन्हें अब तक समझ आ गया होगा कि जिस सनातन धर्म का इतने सारे राजनेता सार्वजनिक रूप से अपमान कर रहे हैं वह वास्तविक सनातन धर्म है ही नहीं, यह वह ‘सनातन धर्म’ है जिसे कुछ अत्यधिक हताश लोगों ने जानबूझकर विकृत रूप में प्रदर्शित किया है, जो न केवल राजनीतिक लाभ से बल्कि उनके नियंत्रण से परे अधर्म और असत्य की गहरी शक्तिओं से प्रेरित एवं प्रभावित हो रहे हैं।</p>
      <p>धर्म के लिए युद्ध, धर्मयुद्ध—चाहे यह कितना ही स्थानीय प्रतीत हो, सर्वदा ब्रह्मांडीय होता है। सनातन धर्म के महान ऋषिओं एवं सिद्धपुरुषों ने युगों-युगों इसे प्रकाशित किया है—इससे पहले कि धर्म के सत्य पृथ्वी पर स्थापित हों और मानव प्रकृति के साथ धर्म का एकीकरण हो, हमें महान आंतरिक और बाहरी युद्ध लड़ने होंगे।</p>
      <p>ऐसा एक युद्ध अब हमारे सामने है, और दोनों पक्षों के बीच की रेखाएँ एक दम स्पष्ट हैं। हम 21 वीं सदी के धर्मयुद्ध के प्रवेशद्वार पर खड़े हैं।</p>
      <p>2024 चुनाव का वर्ष है, जब भारत अपनी 18 वीं लोकसभा चुनेगा। यह चुनाव, यद्यपि, राजनीति एवं राजनैतिक दलों से कहीं अधिक महत्वपूर्ण है। इस बार दाव बहुत ऊँचे होंगे। इस विषय में हमें कोई भ्रम नहीं होना चाहिए—यदि श्री नरेंद्र मोदी की सरकार स्पष्ट बहुमत के साथ वापस नहीं आती हैं, हम भारत के लिए यह युद्ध I.N.D.I.A और वैश्विक वोक (Woke) वादिओं से हार सकते हैं। और यह विषय चतुर नामों एवं शीर्षकों से परे है। भारत एक स्तर पर सभ्यता की निरंतरता और दूसरे स्तर पर वैश्विक मानव भविष्य का प्रतिनिधित्व करता है। वह केवल भारत ही है जिसमें विश्वगुरु बनने की क्षमता है, मानव सभ्यता को एक नयी दुनिया और एक नयी चेतना की और अग्रसर करने की क्षमता, और यह उसे अवश्य करना चाहिये। मानव सभ्यता के विकास में प्रत्येक राष्ट्र की एक नियत भूमिका होती है, और यह विश्व के राष्ट्रों के बीच भारत की नियत भूमिका है। यह 4000 वर्ष पुरानी सभ्यता शक्ति  जिसे हम सनातन धर्म कहते हैं, का स्वाभाविक और अनुकूलित परिणाम है।</p>
      <p>इस सनातन धर्म को उसके वास्तविक रूप में जानना एवं समझना अत्यंत आवश्यक है। यह वास्तव में धर्मयुद्ध का पहला पग है। ज्ञान हमारा प्रथम महान अस्त्र है, एक दिव्य अस्त्र, क्योंकि ज्ञान शक्ति एवं बल प्रदान करता है। और शक्ति का उपयोग जब धर्म के लिए किया जाता है, तो वह दैवीय शक्ति का रूप ले लेती है—जिसे सनातन धर्म में दुर्गा के रूप में महानतापूर्वक दर्शाया गया है। इस दैवीय शक्ति के बिना यह धर्मयुद्ध लड़ा और जीता ही नहीं जा सकता।</p>
      <p>इस लिये, अब—हमारे राष्ट्र, हमारी सभ्यता और आवश्यक रूप से हमारी मानवता के लिए—इस दैवीय शक्ति का आवाहन करने का समय आ गया है।</p>
      <p>धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः — जैसा कि हमारे महान ऋषियों ने घोषित किया था—जब हम धर्म की रक्षा करते हैं तो धर्म हमारी रक्षा करता है।</p>

      <h3>The 2024 elections will go way beyond politics and parties. The stakes are much higher. Let’s have no illusion about this—if Narendra Modi’s government does not come back with a clear majority, we may well lose the battle for Bharat to I.N.D.I.A and the global Woke.</h3>
      <p>One of the reasons—besides, of course, wilful mischief and political expediency—that Sanatan Dharma comes under attack is the fact that most who criticize and attack it know or understand little of it. And this, unfortunately, applies equally to many who seek to defend it. Therefore, most of the public discourse around Sanatan Dharma is drowned out by political or vital-emotional noise. What is needed is reasoned and knowledgeable debate on Dharma across platforms—a crucial necessity as Sanatan Dharma defines and shapes the very nature and character of Indian civilization. It is not a matter to be taken lightly or dismissed as political noise.</p>
      <p>Those of us who know or understand the Sanatan Dharma of our Vedic forefathers—that which I have called the Sanatan Dharma of the Vedas and the Upanishads—would have by now realized that the Sanatan Dharma that is being publicly insulted by so many political leaders is not the real Sanatan Dharma at all, it is the ‘Sanatan Dharma’ wilfully distorted and projected by some deeply desperate people who are being moved not just by political expediencies but deeper forces of adharma and falsehood beyond their control.</p>
      <p>The battle for Dharma, or the dharmayuddha as we would call it, however localized it may seem, is always a cosmic one. This is what the great seers and prophets of Sanatan Dharma have revealed through the ages—that great inner and outer battles have to be fought before the truths of Dharma are established upon earth, and Dharma takes root in human nature.</p>
      <p>Such a battle is upon us now, and the lines are clearly drawn. We are at the threshold of the dharmayuddha of the 21st Century.</p>
      <p>2024 is the election year when India will elect her 18th Lok Sabha. This election will, however, go way beyond politics and parties. The stakes will be much higher. Let’s have no illusion about this—if Narendra Modi’s government does not come back with a clear majority, we may well lose the battle for Bharat to I.N.D.I.A and the global Woke. And this goes beyond smart labels and names. Bharat represents a civilizational continuity at one level and a global human future at another. It is Bharat alone that can, and must, become the vishvaguru, the world-guide, to steer human civilization towards a new world and a new consciousness. Every nation has a destined role to play in the evolution of human civilization, and this is Bharat’s destined role amongst the nations of the world, a natural and logical outcome of a 4000 year old civilizational force that we call the Sanatan Dharma.</p>
      <p>This Sanatan Dharma must be known, and understood, for what it is. That is really the first step in the dharmayuddha. Knowledge, or Jnana, is our first great astra, the divine weapon, for Jnana bestows Shakti—strength and power. And Shakti, when used for Dharma, becomes divine Shakti, that which is so splendidly symbolized by Durga in the Sanatan Dharma. Without divine Shakti, this dharmayuddha cannot be fought and won.</p>
      <p>It is, therefore, time to invoke the divine Shakti for our nation, our civilization, and indeed our humanity. We ourselves, each one of us who wishes to stand for Dharma, must become instruments of this Shakti.</p>
      <p>धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः as our great seers declared—Dharma protects when protected.</p>

      <h3>The Gita is often considered the thirteenth Upanishad, and in the eyes of our traditions, it is Narayana Vak, equal in value to a Sruti. We can say that the Gita is a practical manual of the knowledge contained as symbols in Veda and as intuitive revelations in the Upanishads.</h3>
      <p>The Veda is the oldest text of Indic civilization. It is also its most revered literature, a revelation or what is called the Sruti. Yet, it has been consigned to secondary importance in Indian darshana over the course of time at least in practice, if not in theory, to karmakanda, or hymns meant solely for rituals. The Indic mind, as it moved from the language of ancient symbolism, mantric vibrations, and the polysemic or multi-layered significances of words, seemed to forget the original inspiration behind its most foundational hymns.</p>
      <p>And yet, the esoteric and mystical, the hieratic and spiritual layers of understanding did not disappear completely. Many of the Upanishads themselves professed great admiration for the Veda in their shlokas, and used its spiritual images, phrases, and references freely in an easy commerce between the most ancient and its subsequent Srutis. The tradition of honoring the Veda explicitly continued in the Upanishads and the sacred wisdom of the Veda remained vibrant and alive in the intuitive revelations of the Upanishads.</p>
      <p>But this too seems to have been forgotten. Influenced by the mimansaks, and later interpreters like Sayana and the Western commentators, the modern mind of India largely accepted that the Veda is only the creation of an infantile if not barbaric civilization, that concerned itself primarily with propitiating the gods or devas through its ancient rites, solely to incur their favors in receiving wealth, cows, horses, progeny and victory over enemies.</p>
      <p>Indic commentators such as Swami Dayananda in the 19th and Sri Aurobindo in the 20th centuries attempted to bring out the hidden meaning or the third layer of interpretation of Veda. In their profound and scholarly commentaries, they brought out the secret core of the Vedic mysteries that had been lost. And yet, the impact of their great contribution towards bringing back the spiritual sense of Veda back into national consciousness has met with only partial success. There is still resistance and collective tamas in the understanding of Indologists and traditional Vedic scholars. And the general population or even the reading public never gets to read, forget appreciate, the great secret of the Veda. Interestingly, the west has begun respecting and appreciating the remarkable complexity of the Veda especially in the interpretations of Tatyana Elizarenkova, Stephanie Jamison, and Joel Brereton. The newer translations are no longer as dismissive and arrogant as they used to be earlier in the times of H.H. Wilson and Max Mueller and other early commentators.</p>
      <p>The stupendous breakthrough of Swami Dayananda and Sri Aurobindo has been ably continued by other great Indic translators and exegetes such as T.V. Kapali Sastry, M. P. Pandit, David Frawley, Subhash Kak, R.L. Kashyap, among others. And the great contribution of all these writers and interpreters is slowly being disseminated across the globe today, via published material, social media, and digital books, etc. Of course, much more is needed.</p>
      <p>In this light, it may be worthwhile to note the significant contribution of Sri Krishna in understanding the Veda from a pragmatic and integral perspective. It seems that his emphasis on the symbolic value of the yajna and its spiritual significance has been overlooked by Vedic scholars and exegetes. It is time to revisit what Sri Krishna says about the first Sruti. This, I believe, will not only help us appreciate the Veda better but also the Gita itself for the yajna is one of the key motifs of the Gita. For in just a few shlokas, Sri Krishna reveals the central meaning of the Veda. His insights are extremely profound, precise and assign the right value to Vedic symbols and Vedantic knowledge with respect to each other. Let us look at these shlokas to see what they mean and how they transform our approach to the Veda and change our concept of it being as much jnanakanda as the Upanishads and not just karmakanda.</p>
      <h4>The Gita and the Veda</h4>
      <p>The Gita is often considered the thirteenth Upanishad, and in the eyes of our traditions, it is Narayana Vak, equal in value to a Sruti. We can say that the Gita is a practical manual of the knowledge contained as symbols in Veda and as intuitive revelations in the Upanishads. But we must always remember not to take isolated shlokas as adequate or complete reflectors of its central philosophy since the Gita is a multidimensional work reflecting the personality and genius of its protagonist, Sri Krishna.</p>
      <p>Sri Krishna synthesized many darshanas including Sankhya, yoga, jnana, karma, Vedism, Vedanta, and Vaishnava bhakti, into one comprehensive vision. We too must take the individual shlokas of Gita in one wide synoptic view to appreciate their meaning. For in some shlokas Sri Krishna seems to be criticizing the Vedic Rituals whereas in some he is exalting the significance of the yajna and its significance. Let us try to consider them together to see what he is saying.</p>
      <p>I believe, if we understand his central teaching the key issue of the adhyatmik or spiritual interpretation of the Veda is resolved. For in the Gita, the Vedic symbol of yajna is accorded the highest significance as a way of life. But this is not the external yajna or its interpretation of ritualism, but as a profound symbol of utter self-surrender and offering all one has and is to the Divine. The absolute self-giving of yajna as an inner reality that is the altar of transformation of oneself, giving up the human into the fire of tapasya in return for the Divine. Or shall we say, that the yajna is what in a more modern parlance of Indian adhyatma is called yoga, one of the central meanings of the word yajna.</p>
      <p>The fire of yajna or Agni is Divine Love itself, as the Mother ( of Sri Aurobindo Ashram) explained once. It is also the Divine Will manifest in the Universe, starting from the most inconscient matter, to the plant or vanaspati, to waters or apas, to prana or our vital existence, to our minds as concentration and dhyana, to our hearts as the psychic being or chaitya shakti. Or, as Swami Dayananda beautifully explained in his Rig Veda Bhasha Bhashya, Agni is the vachi of the Atman and the Paramatman. Vachi here means not only a representative but the speech of the Atman and the Paramatman, its manifestation and expression. This Agni is too the illumination in the mind of the higher consciousness and Truth as the symbolic lightning or Vidyut Agni and the Solar Fire or Saurya Agni as the symbol of Sat-Chit-Ananda, the Sun, in the Veda. Agni manifests on each loka or world in various forms and is integral to our understanding of the yajna.</p>
      <p>In the light of the Gita, Agni is Brahma Agni, or the Fire and Light, the intensity and the revelation, of the Brahman. It is our most pure and the most Divine, our most concentrated and the most beautiful. And Sri Krishna retains this symbolism of Agni through his revelatory exposition on the Veda, which is brief but extremely profound, and in a less than a few shlokas captures the essence of our first Sruti, making it easy for a practical application of its deep semiology and visual-auditory-verbal, the symbol-sound-idea, in our worldly existence and as our profoundest dharma.  
      Satyavrata Siddhantalankara in his Hindi translation of the Gita claims that this interpretation of Sri Krishna is something original and was not present in the Indic understanding and exegesis earlier. This is incorrect. The spiritual element of the Veda was present since its very inception as can be noted in the self-referential verses in the Veda itself. One of the verses of Rishi Dirghatamas clearly asserts that the Veda is composed of secret words, ninya vacamsi, and its verse may only be appreciated by another kavi or poet-seer, kavye kavyani nivacana.</p>
      <h4>Yajna, the Leitmotif of Gita</h4>
      <p>Sri Aurobindo in Essays on the Gita says, “The whole of the Gita’s gospel of works rests upon its idea of sacrifice and contains in fact the eternal connecting truth of God and the world and works.” And Sri Krishna brings this out in chapter 3, shloka 9,</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबंधनः । 
      तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसंगः समाचर ॥</p>
      <p>yajñārthātkarmaṇō.nyatra lōkō.yaṅ karmabandhanaḥ. 
      tadarthaṅ karma kauntēya muktasaṅgaḥ samācara৷৷3.9৷৷</p>
      <p>“By doing works otherwise than for sacrifice, this world of men is in bondage to works; for sacrifice practice works, O son of Kunti, becoming free from all attachment.”</p>
      <p>And he continues in the next few shlokas with this clear exhortation,</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः सृष्टा पुरोवाचप्रजापतिः । 
      अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोऽस्त्विष्टकामधुक्‌ ॥</p>
      <p>sahayajñāḥ prajāḥ sṛṣṭvā purōvāca prajāpatiḥ. 
      anēna prasaviṣyadhvamēṣa vō.stviṣṭakāmadhuk৷৷3.10৷৷</p>
      <p>“With sacrifice the Lord of creatures of old created creatures and said, By this shall you bring forth (fruits or offspring), let this be your milker of desires.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः । 
      परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥</p>
      <p>dēvānbhāvayatānēna tē dēvā bhāvayantu vaḥ. 
      parasparaṅ bhāvayantaḥ śrēyaḥ paramavāpsyatha৷৷3.11৷৷</p>
      <p>“Foster by this the gods and let the gods foster you; fostering each other, you shall attain to the supreme good.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः । 
      तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुंक्ते स्तेन एव सः ॥</p>
      <p>iṣṭānbhōgānhi vō dēvā dāsyantē yajñabhāvitāḥ. 
      tairdattānapradāyaibhyō yō bhuṅktē stēna ēva saḥ৷৷3.12৷৷</p>
      <p>“Fostered by sacrifice the gods shall give you desired enjoyments; who enjoys their given enjoyments and has not given to them, he is a thief.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः । 
      भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात्‌ ॥</p>
      <p>yajñaśiṣṭāśinaḥ santō mucyantē sarvakilbiṣaiḥ. 
      bhuñjatē tē tvaghaṅ pāpā yē pacantyātmakāraṇāt৷৷3.13৷৷</p>
      <p>“The good who eat what is left from the sacrifice, are released from all sin; but evil are they and enjoy sin who cook (the food) for their own sake, they verily eat sin.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः । 
      यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ॥</p>
      <p>annādbhavanti bhūtāni parjanyādannasambhavaḥ. 
      yajñādbhavati parjanyō yajñaḥ karmasamudbhavaḥ৷৷3.14৷৷</p>
      <p>“From food creatures come into being, from rain is the birth of food, from sacrifice comes into being the rain, sacrifice is born of work;”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम्‌ । 
      तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम्‌ ॥</p>
      <p>karma brahmōdbhavaṅ viddhi brahmākṣarasamudbhavam. 
      tasmātsarvagataṅ brahma nityaṅ yajñē pratiṣṭhitam৷৷3.15৷৷</p>
      <p>“…work know to be born of Brahman, Brahman is born of the Immutable; therefore is the all-pervading Brahman established in the sacrifice.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः । 
      अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥</p>
      <p>ēvaṅ pravartitaṅ cakraṅ nānuvartayatīha yaḥ. 
      aghāyurindriyārāmō mōghaṅ pārtha sa jīvati৷৷3.16৷৷</p>
      <p>“He who follows not here the wheel thus set in movement, evil is his being, sensual is his delight, in vain, O Partha, that man lives.”</p>
      <p>And Sri Aurobindo, trenchantly shows us that even yajna as a ritual is a symbol, without even interpreting the spiritual significance, if we understand the indication given here. He says, “Even in the passage itself, without the illumining interpretation afterwards given to it in the fourth chapter, we have already an indication of a wider sense where it is said that sacrifice is born from work, work from brahman, brahman from the Akshara, and therefore the all-pervading Brahman, sarvagatam brahma, is established in the sacrifice. The connecting logic of the “therefore” and the repetition of the word brahma are significant; for it shows clearly that the brahman from which all work is born has to be understood with an eye not so much to the current Vedic teaching in which it means the Veda as to a symbolical sense in which the creative Word is identical with the all-pervading Brahman, the Eternal, the one Self present in all existences, sarvabhutesu, and present in all the workings of existence. The Veda is the knowledge of the Divine, the Eternal, — “I am He who is to be known in all the books of the Knowledge,” vedais ca vedyah´, Krishna will say in a subsequent chapter; but it is the knowledge of him in the workings of Prakriti, in the workings of the three gunas, first qualities or modes of Nature, traigunyavisaya vedah …This Brahman or Divine in the workings of Nature is born, as we may say, out of the Akshara, the immutable Purusha, the Self who stands above all the modes or qualities or workings of Nature, nistraigunya.”</p>
      <p>Using the Vedic terms (talk about continuity or what is called in modern semiology, the syntagm of the Veda) Sri Krishna has clearly explained the significance and the meaning of the yajna. But Sri Krishna criticizes those who see the yagna only as a limited ritual to gain favors and he is extremely clear about this too in the second chapter: </p>
      <p class="hindi-text">यामिमां पुष्पितां वाचं प्रवदन्त्यविपश्चितः । 
      वेदवादरताः पार्थ नान्यदस्तीति वादिनः ॥2.42॥</p>

      vēdavādaratāḥ pārtha nānyadastīti vādinaḥ৷৷2.42৷৷</p>
      <p>“This flowery word which they declare who have not clear discernment, devoted to the creed of the Veda, whose creed is that there is nothing else…”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">कामात्मानः स्वर्गपरा जन्मकर्मफलप्रदाम्‌ ।

      <p>“…souls of desire, seekers of paradise, , — it gives the fruits of the works of birth, it is multifarious with specialities of rites, it is directed to enjoyment and lordship as its goal.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम्‌ ।

      <p>“The intelligence of those who are misled by that (flowery word), and cling to enjoyment and leadership, is not established in the self with concentrated fixity.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन |  निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान् || 2.45||</p>
      <p>“The action of the three gunas is the subject matter of the Veda; but do thou, o Arjuna, become free from the trtiple Guna, without the dualities, ever based in the true being, without getting or having, possessed of the Self.”</p>
      <p>The Significance of Sacrifice</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">गतसङ्‍गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः ।

      <p>“When a man liberated, free from attachment, with his mind, heart and spirit firmly founded in self-knowledge, does works as sacrifice, all his work is dissolved.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्रौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम्‌ ।

      <p>“The sacrifice of knowledge, O Parantapa, is greater than any material sacrifice. Knowledge is that in which all actions culminate (not any lower knowledge but the highest self-knowledge and God-knowledge), Partha!</p>
      <p>And Sri Aurobindo elaborates thus, “Sacrifice is the law of the world and nothing can be gained without it, neither mastery here, nor the possession of heavens beyond, nor the supreme possession of all; “this world is not for him who doeth not sacrifice, how then any other world?” Therefore all these and many other forms of sacrifice have been “extended in the mouth of the Brahman,” the mouth of that Fire which receives all offerings; they are all means and forms of the one great Existence in activity, means by which the action of the human being can be offered up to That of which his outward existence is a part and with which his inmost self is one. They are “all born of work;” all proceed from and are ordained by the one vast energy of the Divine which manifests itself in the universal karma and makes all the cosmic activity a progressive offering to the one Self and Lord and of which the last stage for the human being is self-knowledge and the possession of the divine or Brahmic consciousness. “So knowing thou shalt become free.”</p>
      <h4>The Three Meanings of Veda</h4>
      <p>Trayortha sarva vedeshu, or there are ‘three meanings in the Veda throughout,’ as T.V. Kapali Sastri pointed out in his work Light on the Vedas. These three layers are adhi bhautik, adhi daivik and adhyatmik, or the physical, the mythological and the spiritual. Sri Krishna dwells on all three but in brief gives us the central key to understanding the Veda.</p>
      <p>It is not that he created this understanding out of thin air under an original impulse and interpretation of the first Sruti. He continued the tradition of seeing the Veda as an evocation and description of a deeper reality, in ritual as well as its symbols, in chhanda as well meaning. Sri Krishna brings out the very essence of Veda in a matter of two dozen shlokas and if we consider them together, we have what Swami Dayananda and Sri Aurobindo tried to explain several millennia later. Sri Krishna gives us the guideposts in our approach to the Veda. And it should no longer be a matter of debate or contention that he continued an original tradition and insight of the Vedic Rishis and captured the essence of its symbolism.</p>
      <p>He is another reason we might wish to look at the Veda again in a new but ancient light that it has always possessed.</p>

      <h3>सनातन धर्म पर हो रहे इस आक्रमण का वास्तविक रूप क्या है? क्या हम इसके पीछे कि मानसिकता को समझ सकते है?</h3>
      <p>वह केवल स्टालिन जूनियर ही नहीं है जिसने इस बार लक्ष्मण रेखा का उल्लंघन किया है। ऐसे कई अन्य लोग हैं जो हिंदू धर्म और इसकी तथाकथित सामाजिक ‘ बुराइयों’ के विरोध में उग्र रहे हैं और इसके विनाश के लिए चिल्लाते रहे हैं। स्वर भिन्न हो सकते हैं, कटाक्ष से लेकर स्पष्ट अहंकार तक, लेकिन भाव हमेशा एक ही रहा है— हिंदू धर्म एक पथभ्रष्ट धर्म है। और उन्होंने यह लक्ष्मण रेखा सौ बार पार की है, और सौ बार हमने इसे स्वीकार किया है, क्षमा भी किया है, और संभवतः हमेशा शक्ति के आधार पर नहीं। पर अब? यह शिशुपाल के 101 वे प्रहार के समान है। और आज जन्माष्टमी है, जिस दिन हम श्री कृष्ण के मानव काल में अवतरण का उत्सव मनाते हैं।</p>
      <p>आज तक, 262 प्रतिष्ठित व्यक्तिओं ने भारत के मुख्य न्यायाधीश को एक पत्र लिखा है जिसमे स्टालिन की टिप्पणियों पर विशेष रूप से ध्यान देने की माँग की गयी है। बहुतों ने बिना शर्त क्षमायाचना की माँग की है। पर क्या इस सब से वास्तव में कुछ बदलाव होगा? यह रोग बहुत गहरा है। हमें पहले मूल तत्वों पर ध्यान देना होगा। क्या, या किसका, है यह ‘ सनातन धर्म’  जिस पर यह लोग आक्रमण कर रहें है? वह ‘ सनातन धर्म’ जिससे यह लोग इतनी प्रबलता से घृणा करते है और जिस पर आक्रमण करते है केवल एक ‘ नाम- मात्र’ है, एक सुशील शब्द मात्र, उस हिंदू धर्म के लिए जिसे वह समझ नहीं सकते, और निश्चित रूप से यह वेद और उपनिषद्, महाभारत और रामायण का सनातन धर्म नहीं है। वह ‘ सनातन धर्म’ इनके अधिकार क्षेत्र से कहीं अधिक परे है। जो यह लोग देखते हैं और जिस पर आक्रमण करते हैं, वह उनकी स्थूल इंद्रियों और उनकी मानसिकता की कल्पित, सीमित एवं खंडित ‘ वास्तविकता’ है। सनातन धर्म के मौलिक सत्यों को जानने के लिए सबसे पहले व्यक्ति को स्वयं के अविकसित राक्षसी रूप से कुछ अधिक सूक्ष्म, अधिक परिष्कृत बनने की आवश्यकता है। स्मरण रहे, सनातन धर्म के दृष्टिकोण से, राक्षस वह कुरूप पुरुष नहीं है जिसे हम बाल पुस्तकों के चित्रों में देखते है, वह असुर का प्रतिरूप है— एक विशालकाय अहंकार, घमंड और क्षुद्र मानसिकता वाले नीच लोगों की सोच समझ कर की गई हिंसा। और यह भी स्मरण रहे, राक्षस के लिए, आमतौर से, किसी भी तर्क या चेतना का कोई महत्व नहीं होता। राक्षस का ‘ धर्म’ है— उकसाना, भ्रमित करना, भटकाना और भंग करना।</p>
      <p>और वह लोग सनातन धर्म पर आक्रमण इसलिए नहीं करते क्योंकि वह उसे समझते हैं— और इसलिए उससे घृणा करते हैं— बल्कि इस लिये क्योंकि वह उसे समझ नहीं सकते। यह असुर का पुराना गुण है। वह सब जिसकी उन्हें समझ नहीं है, जिसे वह समझ नहीं सकते, जो स्पष्ट रूप से उनकी समझ से परे है— उस पर आक्रमण करना और उसके विनाश का प्रयास करना।</p>
      <p>इसलिए, वह लोग किसी एक धार्मिक प्रथा या सामाजिक परंपरा को लेते हैं— उदाहरण स्वरूप, जाति व्यवस्था— और उस पर जो भी उनके विचार के अनुसार सनातन धर्म है, उसे थोप देते हैं। फिर वह धर्म की निंदा करते है— या ठीक से कहें तो, जो उनकी धर्म की समझ या नासमझ है, उसकी निंदा करते— और उसके पश्चात धर्म के विनाश की माँग करते है क्योंकि “ वह असमानता को जन्म देता है” । पहले तो, वह बिलकुल भी कोई प्रयास नहीं करते, उस धर्म को समझने का, जिसका वह अपमान करते हैं और जिस पर आक्रमण करते हैं। उन्हें सनातन धर्म के मूल सिद्धांतों और मूल्यों, उसके दर्शन, उसके विश्व- दृष्टिकोण की कोई भी समझ नहीं है, ना ही यह समझ है कि सनातन धर्म किस प्रकार से इस सब को सामाजिक, राजनैतिक, आर्थिक एवं सांस्कृतिक व्यवस्थाओं में परिवर्तित एवं संयोजित करने का प्रयास करता है।</p>
      <p>और उनके ज्ञान और समझ में इस मूलभूत अंतर के कारण, स्पष्ट रूप से वह सामाजिक एवं सांस्कृतिक प्रथाओं को पुराने समय से समझने में या उनका पुनर्निर्माण करने में असमर्थ है और उन्हें उस रूप में ही देख सकते है जैसे की वह वर्तमान में हैं: रीति- रिवाज और प्रथाएँ जो पीढ़ियों से चली आ रही सामाजिक और मानसिक गतिशीलता के अनुसार विकसित या अविकसित हुई हैं। यही कारण है की कोई भी धर्म, समाज, व्यवस्था— त्रुटिपूर्ण रीति- रिवाज और अनुचित प्रथाओं से परे नहीं है। दूसरे शब्दों में, वह लोग एक परंपरा पर ध्यान देते है, उसके व्यापक और गहरे मानवीय या सामाजिक सन्दर्भ को समझे बिना।</p>
      <p>यह बौद्धिक आलस्य है, संभवतः अपने आप में हानि रहित, परंतु जब इसे राष्ट्रीय राजनैतिक चर्चा में लाया जाता है तो यह हानिकारक और उपद्रवी है। क्योंकि तब, यह एक नैतिक मुद्दा बन जाता है।</p>

      <h3>What is the real nature of the attack on Sanatan Dharma? Can we understand the psychology behind it?</h3>
      <p>It’s not just Stalin Jr. who has crossed the line this time. There have been many others who have been fulminating against Hindu Dharma and its so-called social ‘ills’ and crying for its destruction. The tone may have varied, from insinuation to outright arrogance, but the sentiment has always been the same—Hinduism is an aberration. And they have crossed the line a hundred times, and a hundred times we have accepted, even forgiven, and perhaps not always out of strength. But now? Shishupala’s 101st strike?</p>
      <p>As of today, 262 eminent persons have sent a letter to the Chief Justice of India asking him to take cognizance of Stalin’s comments. Many have demanded unconditional apology. But then, will any of that make a real difference? The malaise goes far deeper. We need to address the fundamentals first. What, or whose, is this ‘Sanatan Dharma’ that these people are attacking? The ‘Sanatan Dharma’ that they so vehemently despise and attack is just the label, at best a euphemistic term for a Hindu Dharma they cannot fathom, and certainly not the Sanatan Dharma of the Vedas and the Upanishads, the Mahabharata and the Ramayan. That Sanatan Dharma is way beyond their pay grade. What they see and attack is the limited and fragmented ‘reality’ their gross senses and intellect project. To grasp the truths of Sanatan Dharma, one needs first to evolve from the crude rakshasic to something subtler, more refined, more sukshma. Remember, in the language of Sanatan Dharma, the “rakshasa” is not the monster of comic books but the representation of the Asura—the exaggerated ego, the arrogance and wilful violence of the petty-minded and the mean-spirited. Also remember, the rakshasa, typically, does not care for reason or rationality. Its ‘dharma’ is to provoke, confuse, mislead, disrupt.</p>
      <p>And they attack Sanatan Dharma not because they understand it—and so despise it—but precisely because they do not. This is an old trait of the asura. To attack and destroy what they do not, or cannot, understand, what so clearly surpasses their understanding.</p>
      <p>Therefore they take up a particular religious practice or social tradition—casteism, for instance—and superpose it on what they, in their wisdom, believe to be Sanatan Dharma. Then they condemn the Dharma—more accurately, their understanding, or rather misunderstanding, of it—and ask for its eradication because “it breeds inequality”. They do not, first of all, care to understand the Dharma they attack and insult. They have no idea of its foundational principles and values, its darshan, its worldview, or how it attempts to translate and organize them into social, political, economic and cultural systems.</p>
      <p>And because of this fundamental gap in their knowledge and understanding, they are clearly unable to trace back, or deconstruct, social and cultural customs and practices and see them for what they are: customs and practices that have evolved or devolved according to social and psychological dynamics playing out over generations. The precise reason why no religion, society, or system is exempt from flawed customs and unjust practices. In other words, they focus on a tradition without going into its larger or deeper human or social contexts. Like condemning the forest for a rotting tree.</p>
      <p>This is intellectual laziness, harmless perhaps by itself, but pernicious and mischievous when brought into national political discourse. For then, it becomes a moral issue.</p>

      <h3>“जब सनातन धर्म क्षीण होता है तब राष्ट्र भी क्षीण होता है। और यदि सनातन धर्म का विनाश कभी संभव हो तो इस राष्ट्र का भी उस सनातन धर्म के संग ही समापन हो जाएगा।” श्री अरविंद</h3>
      <p>सनातन धर्म का विनाश? सच में? उन योग्य व्यक्तियों की उच्च- ध्वनि वाली राजनीतिक भाषणकला से परे, जो ऐसे बयान देते हैं और इनका समर्थन करते हैं, यह व्यवहार, सबसे अधिक, उस भयावह और आक्रामक विरोध के स्वरूप को प्रकट करता है, जिसका हमें आने वाले महीनों में सामना करना होगा। धर्म पर इस प्रकार के आक्रमणों का तर्क- वितर्क से विरोध करना, एक जानवर के सामने गुर्राने के समान पूर्णतः व्यर्थ और असम्मानजनक होगा।</p>
      <p>हम जो धर्म की रक्षा करना चाहते हैं, केवल इस ढंग से इस प्रकार के घातक आक्रमण का विरोध कर सकते हैं— कृपया यह न भूलें, यह जो श्री स्टालिन जूनियर ने’ सनातन विनाश सम्मेलन’ के अन्य गणमान्य व्यक्तियों के साथ अंततः व्यक्त किया है, वह केवल शुरुआत है, एक अच्छी तरह से विचार किए गए अभियान की, जो सनातन धर्म के सभी मूल्यों के विरुद्ध असत्य और अधर्म का प्रसार करेगा– हमें इन झूठों और विकृतियों का विरोध सत्यों के माध्यम से करना होगा। और यह मायने नहीं रखता कि जो लोग ऐसी विकृतियों का उद्घोष करते हैं, उन्हें सत्य में कोई रुचि नहीं है— महत्वपूर्ण यह है कि हम तथ्यों को निष्पक्ष रूप से व्यक्त करें। जैसा कि अरविंद नीलकंदन ने लिखा है, “ जिन्हें सनातन धर्म का ज्ञान है, उनके लिए एक व्यापक प्रतिक्रिया शुरू करने का समय आ गया है, सनातन मूल्यों को धारण करने वाले हिंदू संगठन के साथ।”</p>
      <p>एक क्षण के लिए इस पर विचार करें कि वास्तव में श्री स्टालिन जूनियर ने क्या कहा-” क्या है सनातन? सनातन का मतलब है कि कुछ भी बदला नहीं जा सकता और सब कुछ स्थायी है। लेकिन द्रविड़ विचारधारा परिवर्तन और सभी के लिए समानता की मांग करती है।” क्या यह सत्य है? यदि कोई व्यक्ति सनातन धर्म के आधारभूत सिद्धांतों का अध्ययन सतही पूर्वक भी करे, तो उसे स्पष्ट हो जाएगा कि सनातन धर्म केवल सत् को ही नित्य और अपरिवर्तनीय मानता है। सभी बाकी वस्तुएँ अनित्य और परिवर्तनशील हैं। इसलिए, सामाजिक प्रथाएँ— चाहे उनका परम मूल्य कुछ भी क्यों न हो— नित्य नहीं मानी जा सकतीं— वे स्पष्ट रूप से परिवर्तन और विकास के अधीन हैं। कोई भी मानव समाज या संस्कृति, कोई भी सामाजिक या सांस्कृतिक मान्यता या मूल्य प्रणाली, स्थिर या अपरिवर्तनीय नहीं हो सकती, उन्हें जीवित रहने और गहरी मानवीय आवश्यकताओं के प्रति प्रासंगिक बने रहने के लिए आवश्यक रूप से विकासशील और गतिशील होना चाहिए। यह बात हमारे धार्मिक ऋषियों ने बार- बार, तीखे शब्दों में कही है।</p>
      <p>जहाँ और जब भी सामाजिक और राजनीतिक तंत्र या मान्यताएँ स्थिर होने या अविकसित होने लगीं, वहाँ व्यक्तिगत या सामूहिक रूप से विचारक और सुधारक उभरे, यथास्थिति को भंग करने के लिए, उस पर सवाल उठाने, यहाँ तक कि उसे चुनौती देने और उसे तोड़ने के लिए। सनातन धर्म के इतिहास का प्रारंभिक अध्ययन भी इस बात को स्पष्ट कर देगा।</p>
      <p>और सामाजिक समानता? हालांकि मनुस्मृति और वेदों की सभी जानबूझकर की गई ग़लत व्याख्याओं और ग़लतफ़हमियों के बावजूद, यह सच्चाई बनी रहती है कि सनातन धर्म निर्विवाद रूप से सबसे समतावादी दर्शन है जिसे मनुष्य ने सदियों से विकसित किया है। सनातन धर्म का पहला सिद्धांत है, एकम सत्— अस्तित्व एक है और अद्वैत है। फिर सनातन धर्म में असमानता का सुझाव तक भी कैसे हो सकता है? इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि हिंदू समाज में असमानता नहीं है। अवश्य है। और यह कहाँ नहीं है? कौन सा धर्म, समाज या व्यवस्था ऐसी है जहाँ असमानता नहीं है? अहंभाव, अहंकार, लालच, असुरक्षा— ये सभी हमारी मूल एवं असहाय मानवीय स्थिति के लक्षण हैं और व्यक्तिगत या सामूहिक रूप से हमे अन्यता, विशिष्टतावाद और असमानता की ओर ले जाते हैं। इनका हमारे धर्म या राजनीति से कोई लेना- देना नहीं है। लेकिन इसका यह अर्थ कैसे निकाला जा सकता है कि सनातन धर्म दोषपूर्ण है?</p>
      <p>यदि हम एक परमाणु बम गिराकर हज़ारों लोगों की जान ले लें, तो क्या इसका अर्थ यह है कि परमाणु भौतिकी दोषपूर्ण है? क्या हम सच में इन दोनों में अंतर नहीं समझ सकते? या फिर कोई गहरा मानसिक व आध्यात्मिक रोग है जो हमें विवश करता है ऐसी बेमानी और असत्य बातें करने के लिए?</p>
      <p>जैसा कि श्री अन्नामलाई ने कहा: ” मुगलों ने सनातन धर्म को समाप्त करने की कोशिश की, लेकिन वे असफल रहे। ईस्ट इंडिया कंपनी ने कोशिश की, लेकिन वे भी असफल रहे। 1800 के दशक के अंत में केवल दक्षिण भारत, विशेष रूप से तिरुनेलवेली, कांचीपुरम, चेन्नई के कुछ हिस्सों में आए ईसाई मिशनरियों ने अपना सर्वश्रेष्ठ प्रयास किया।  वे इसे समाप्त नहीं कर सके…” </p>
      <p>क्या हमें इस विषय पर और कुछ कहने की आवश्यकता है?</p>

      <h3>“When the Sanatan Dharma declines, then the nation declines, and if the Sanatan Dharma were capable of perishing, with the Sanatan Dharma it would perish..” Sri Aurobindo</h3>
      <p>The eradication of Sanatan Dharma? Seriously? Beyond the high-decibel political rhetoric of the worthies who make and support such statements, this, more than anything else, reveals the all-fangs bared nature of the opposition we shall be confronting in the months to come. To counter this kind of attack on Dharma by debate or counter-attack would be similar to snarling back at the beast—perfectly useless and undignified.</p>
      <p>The only way we, who wish to stand for Dharma, can resist this kind of onslaught—for make no mistake, what Mr. Stalin Jr. has finally articulated along with the other worthy dignitaries of the so-called ‘‘Sanatana Destruction Conference’’ is but the beginning of a well thought-out campaign of falsehood, adharma, against all that the Dharma stands for—is by confronting lies and distortions with truths. And it shouldn’t at all matter that those who articulate such distortions will not in the least be interested in truths—what matters at this time is the emotionless stating of facts. As Aravind Neelakandan writes, “It is time for those who know what Sanatana Dharma is to launch a comprehensive response, with Hindu Sangathan as the embodiment of Sanatana values.” </p>
      <p>Reflect for a moment on what exactly Mr. Stalin Jr. said—“What is Sanatana? Sanatana means nothing should be changed and all are permanent. But the Dravida model calls for change and all should be equal.”Is that so? Sanatan Dharma, if one cares to study its foundational truths even cursorily, regards only the absolute truth, Sat, as permanent, unchanging. All else is impermanent, anityam. Social practices, therefore, whatever be their ultimate value, cannot be regarded as nityam—they are self-evidently subject to change and evolution. No human society or culture, no social or cultural belief or value system, can be static or permanent, they need must be evolutionary and dynamic to remain alive and relevant to deeper human needs. This is what our Dharmic seers have stated repeatedly, trenchantly.</p>
      <p>Wherever and whenever social or political systems or beliefs have tended to stagnate or ossify, there have been thinkers and reformers who have risen, individually or collectively, to disturb the status-quo, to question, even challenge, and disrupt. Even a preliminary study of the history of Dharma will bear this out.</p>
      <p>And equality? In spite of all the deliberate and often mischievous misreadings and misunderstandings of Manu Smriti and the Vedas, the fact of the matter remains that Sanatan Dharma is unarguably the most egalitarian darshan that humans have evolved over the ages. The first principle of the Sanatan Dharma is oneness of being—ekam Sat, reality is one and indivisible, non-dual. How then can there be even a suggestion of inequality in the Sanatan Dharma? This is not to say that inequality does not exist on the ground, in the day to day reality of Hindu society. Of course it does. And where, pray, does it not? In which religion, society or system does it not exist? Egoism, arrogance, self-interest, insecurity, greed, all leading to otherness, exclusivism and inequality, are characteristics of our essential—and hapless—human condition, whether individual or collective, and it doesn’t matter what religion or politics we follow. But how does any of this mean that Sanatan Dharma is flawed?</p>
      <p>If we destroy thousands of human lives by dropping an atom bomb, does that mean nuclear physics is flawed? And do we seriously not know the difference? Or is there a deeper disease of the mind and spirit that compels us, perhaps in spite of ourselves, to express such inanities and falsehoods?</p>
      <p>As Shri Annamalai pointed out: “Mughals tried to eradicate Sanatana Dharma, they couldn’t do it. East India Company tried, they couldn’t do it. The Christian missionaries who only came to southern part of India, specifically to Tirunelveli, to parts of Kanchipuram, Chennai, they tried their best in the late 1800s. They couldn’t abolish it…”</p>
      <p>Need we say more?</p>

      <h3>“India as a Rajasic nation is a future that is already happening. It is inevitable, it is preordained. And it is happening now”. Gautam Chikermane on the rise of India as a ‘Rajasic nation’.</h3>
      <p>I met some young people here—somebody learning martial arts, somebody doing a start-up, somebody is doing design, strategy. I found something that is binding all of us together is the Rajasic force that our nation is going through right now.</p>
      <p>In my job, I get to meet foreign dignitaries, ministers, academics, some from think tanks, students, media, and they are all trying to figure out exactly what’s going on with our country right now. In the process of answering those questions, I too had to figure out what is happening in our country. Yes, you can see several activities everywhere around us—in economics, entertainment, science, technology, start-ups, money. But underlying all this is a force coming out of our country: it’s called the Rajasic Force, which is what I will be talking about.</p>
      <p>Before I begin, I would like to situate this force so that you can imagine the kind of treasure that India has, that still exists today from which we can pick up and enlighten our lives. These I call the spiritual sciences of India. There is the science of the soul. There is the science of life. There is the science of bhakti, faith. There is a science within the Darshanas. As everybody would be knowing, there are six astik Darshanas of which Sankhya is one. Within Sankhya there are two main directions, one given by the Purusha, the other by Prakriti. And Prakriti expresses the Purusha through three modes, which is Sattwa, Tamas and Rajas.</p>
      <p>Tamas, as we know is inertia, indolence, laziness, weakness. A Tamasic person just barely manages to survive. He just wants to go on with life, with as little disturbances as possible. A Rajasic person engages with life with full of enthusiasm, with dynamism. He kills, he conquers, he brings, he builds huge things but essentially it’s egoistic. And Sattwa is voice, knowledge and balance which keeps the Rajasic and the Tamasic tendencies in balance. A Sattvic person for instance in the middle of battle would seek harmony, peace, the right path as Sri Ram did in one of the previous incarnations.</p>
      <p>These are the three gunas. The body of the work is there in Isha Upanishad, Bhagavad Gita, Shivapurana. And the Puranas themselves are divided into three parts, six are Sattvic, six Rajasic and six Tamasic. These are the eighteen Mahapuranas.</p>
      <p>All of us, every individual has in himself or herself an admixture of the three gunas. The dominance of one over the other defines who you are. Are you a Rajasic person? Are you a Tamasic person? Are you a Sattvic person? I also feel that these tatvas, these forces inside us, they keep changing their dynamic because we ourselves are evolving. As we evolve, our natures change, these characteristics change. We recoil, we embrace, we rise, we fall.</p>
      <p>For instance, Arjun is, as we know, a Rajasic warrior, but when he faces his grandfather, his cousins, as the humongous army of the Kauravas before him, he recoils from battle. The Tamas inside him rises and begins to smother the Rajasic tendencies. As we all know, Sri Krishna brought him back and put him on track. Arjun said it’s better to be a renunciate than to kill your own people. Sri Krishna says the renunciation has to be within and not just an outer renunciation.</p>
      <p>There are three platforms on which the gunas work. According to Rishi Kapil, who put the Sankhya philosophy together, and Ved Vyas in the Mahabharata, it applies to individuals as I explained. Ved Vyas in Shiva Purana says the entire divinities are part of the gunas. For instance, Brahma, the Creator, is Rajas, so is Saraswati. Vishnu, the preserver, is Sattwa, so is Sati. And Rudra, the destroyer is Tamas, so is Lakshmi. Shiva is beyond the gunas, just as in the Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna is beyond the gunas.</p>
      <p>Sri Aurobindo applies the theory of gunas to nations. According to him, the dominant trait of a nation, which is what I’ve been talking about, which is what you see in this room, this energy, this flow of creativity, this building that’s happening all around us, the political change, the global footprints, all that is part of a national guna, which today we are seeing to be Rajasic.</p>
      <p>The spiritual expression of collectives from the individual but before the divinities, those collectives…when people of various hues form themselves into a singular consciousness, what is that dominant force? Today it’s Rajasic. In ancient India, it was Rajasic. It was the time of knowledge, ideas, temples, institutions, libraries, wealth, trade. In medieval India. I think as a consciousness we fell into Tamas. This not only enabled invaders to come, in fact, I get a feeling that we almost invited invaders into India. We lost our power, our wealth, confidence. We lost our faith. We lost our religion. Essentially, we lost this Rajasic force.</p>
      <p>Sri Aurobindo says that the history of nations, when you examine them through these three characteristics, is a movement, a circular motion between the Rajas and Tamas. The Sattwic ideal has been expressed in some individuals but not as a collective so far. When you see the rise and fall of nations, which I will come to shortly, it is a journey from Rajas to Tamas and back.</p>
      <p>Despite being conquered, despite being invaded, the flame of Rajasic energy continued to burn somewhere in our country, in some of us. Now it is rising again. It probably began with the freedom movement. It attained political freedom, but we remained economically and culturally captured. Now we see an economic unshackling happening. This began in 1991. Cultural freedom will follow, and I think it’s also going to power the rest of the other freedoms.</p>
      <p>Since 2000 onwards, this is my opinion, I see this Rajasic force attaining critical mass. We see it in geopolitics, in governance, we see it in economy, in finance. We see it in literature, films. We see it in cultural push backs in terms of getting our stolen idols back. All these require Rajasic energies which are now you can see them form around you. All constituents, all major constituents, the dominant trait today what I see, what I observe, is a Rajasic trait. It is the urge to do something and I sense it in this room very strongly.</p>
      <p>One of the expressions of the Rajasic force that we keep talking about in terms of a number is India is a $10 trillion economy. What does $10 trillion even mean? For every trillion dollar that India rises, we see an increase in $700 in per capita income. That’s approximately 56,000 rupees of per capita income. That’s approximately a little more than 2 lakh rupees for a household. What does this 2 lakh rupee increase in the household income, per capita income mean? It changes a lot of things.</p>
      <p>In international Rajas, we see a new assertiveness that is coming up over a meekness that used to exist. We have today the ability to influence global events and we are doing it very smartly without getting too aggressive. For instance, the manner in which the Russia-Ukraine war and India taking oil from Russia has been countered. We see it in the manner in which India is trying to help poorer nations. In G20 for instance.</p>
      <p>There is a policy Rajas happening where there is an ease of life which is unshackling individual citizen Rajas. There is a catalyzing of the economy that is powering the business Rajas. Only yesterday, two days ago, the Janviswas Bill was passed where 113 compliances for which you could be imprisoned while doing business, have been decriminalized. And there will be more such. There is the rise of a domestic knowledge systems, the cultural Rajas, which is what this conversation is all about.</p>
      <p>All our outer expressions are being driven by an inner Rajas. I’m going to take two small points before I get to the larger parts.</p>
      <p>Is it being driven by India’s youth? India has among the lowest dependency ratios. Japan is 71, France 64, India is 47. Not only that, India is 47 and it is falling. If you see United States, the dependency ratio is 54 and it is rising. In China it is 45, less than India, but it is rising. In EU it is 57 and rising. In Japan it’s 71 and rising. In India it’s 47 and falling. The only competitor that I see is Indonesia and Thailand. Thailand, it doesn’t have the scale but Indonesia is 47 and falling. India is 47 and falling. Indonesia is a $1.3 trillion economy. India is 3.3 trillion. Let’s see where this goes.</p>
      <p>Could it be that the Rajasic energies are happening because of our changing food preferences? Let’s examine this. Extreme poverty has almost been eradicated. It was 0.8% according to IMF, it is 5.7% according to ADB, it is 8.9% according to World Bank. And in 1987 it was 50%. Half of our population was under extreme poverty. Even if we take the last, the biggest number, less than 10% is in extreme poverty. In the next three or four years, we’re going to be 0 poverty.</p>
      <p>This is impacting our food choices. It is impacting our gunas, let’s see how. The cereal consumption of individuals between 1994 and 2012, has fallen. That’s the latest data. The new data will happen, it’s happening, going to begin now and maybe in the next two or three years we will have that data and I’m sure this trend will continue. In those years we have seen that cereal consumption is down, vegetables are up. These are Sattwic foods. Vegetables are up 60%, eggs are up 202%. This is Rajasic food, Chicken is up 1,000%. </p>
      <p>We are eating more Rajasic food than we have ever done before. The masalas, the spices consumption has increased by 1,000% as well. Is Artha powering Rajas? Probably.</p>
      <p>I have just taken two but now you look around you, be it in the area of ideas, aspirations, entertainment, spirituality, Dharma, temples, wealth, schools, sports, anywhere you look, you examine it through the lens of these gunas and you will see what I am talking about. We are becoming a Rajasic nation.</p>
      <p>Is the Rajasic force permanent? No, Sri Aurobindo has already said that and let’s see what happened. Until 1000 AD India was the Rajasic nation of the world. There was huge wealth, there was power, there was force. India was going out. Then, we began to lose it. This Rajasic force moved to Europe. From Europe, it went to Japan and the US. Japan is at 71, I told you 71 dependency ratio. It’s full of old people. United States has the capacity to bring young people. From United States the rajasic force moved to China, which to me is an Asuric nation. And it is now coming back to India. </p>
      <p>In Europe, between the 1500 and 1950s, there was renaissance, colonial conquest. You had the musicians, you had the painters, you had the industrial revolution. Today that Rajasic force is ebbing, it’s before our eyes. There is low growth, there is low fertility, there are strategic blunders. Europe is moving towards irrelevance and still not being able to decide whether what it wants to do, how it wants to move forward. The people who invaded India during the Turkic invasions are the people who are joining as going to Europe as immigrants today. It is attracting the worst form of immigrants. I am not saying this. There are Islamic scholars who are saying this, that there is no problem in so many of our Islamic nations. The persons who are running away are those who we don’t want. They are going to Europe. Tamas is settling in. Will the new Europe be a Tamas-driven Rajas area? Will it turn asuric? We don’t know. At the moment it seems to be in that direction.</p>
      <p>Japan between 1850 and 1950 began as a military power. It colonized China, Taiwan, Korea. Sri Aurobindo says it was the time of their Rajas, rise due to the samurai culture. That Rajasic force is now ebbing. There is aging, there is low growth, there is low fertility. Tamas has set in. It is in a state of a wealthy but stable Tamas.</p>
      <p>The US from 1900 till date was a geography where immense innovations happened, they sent a man to the moon. It was a place where wealth was created. It became the most powerful nation in the world. It created institutions, it created public goods, it created global public goods. It created the United Nations, World Bank, IMF. The Rajasic force today seems to be ebbing in society, possibly in domestic politics as well. But in the areas of technology, in the areas of business, military, markets, America still stands at the top. Also, the US has this propensity to be able to absorb, to be able to import the Rajasic forces, the best of Rajasic forces from across the world. Will it continue to do so? Apparently so. It does look to be like that. But it is internally dealing with very strange problems. For instance, gender. The Gunas are in a transition conversation in the United States. </p>
      <p>In China from 1990 till date, actually it began in 1980s but the force got economic momentum during the 1990s, around the time that India also began with the 1991 reforms, is been functioning under a Tamasic Rajasic force. It has tensions on all its borders other than North Korea and Pakistan. There is wolf diplomacy, there is debt trap engagements. There is a beggar-thy-partner strategy. It has weaponized everything from trade, diplomacy, currency, education, markets, companies and even individuals. There are five laws that have turned every organization, entity, including individuals, into a potential spy. At some point, this Rajas, the domestic Rajas of the nation, will fight the authoritarian Rajas. That is the Chinese Communist Party. In fact, China is actually a Chinese Communist Party, to which is appended a nation called China. Momentum will keep it going but it is inviting its own decline. This is a Tamas driven Rajasic and Asuric nation. </p>
      <p>In India from 2000 till date the memory of our Rajasic force that we were once powerful, that we were once wealthy, that we were once the temples of education, literature, arts, architecture, has been forgotten. That memory is being revived now. It was lost because of the education, because of policies. It is like you have the white man’s burden, you have the Bharatiya’s burden. </p>
      <p>The GDP in 1000 AD was 28% of world GDP. Today it is 3.5%. Sri Aurobindo says India needs its Kshatriya Dharma back. Our Kshatriyas need to come back. Kshatriyas are Rajasic in their nature. It is now returning. It is reaching a critical mass. It is likely to be a force for good. It is not going to be a Tamas-driven Rajasic nation. It is,in my opinion, going to be a Sattwa-driven Rajasic nation.</p>
      <p>We have already created the public goods to which power my argument. Look at the our vaccine diplomacy. Look at the manner in which the Western countries were trying to scratch the whole world to their benefit. And look at the way India created its own vaccine and gave it to other countries for free. Look at our UPI. Look at the manner in which we engage with peace, but this time from a position of strength, not because we are weak. We want peace because we are strong. We want peace because we can ensure that we can demand peace and we can get that peace.</p>
      <p>The national Rajas, as I talked about, comprises the individual Rajas. Each individual needs to awaken it, contribute to our national Rajas. Tamas will continue to pull us down. We have enough enemies, within and outside. Not only that, we have our enemies within us. We have the fear of narratives, we have the fear of battle, we have the fear of loss. All these need to go away. It’s going away. If we do nothing, Prakriti will still continue to do her work. We will continue to go. If we become conscious, we will enable Prakriti to go faster. </p>
      <p>I come back to this slide that I had begun with, in my earlier part. This slide defines Sanatan Dharma. This is what Sri Aurobindo had to say about it: “When the Sanatan Dharma declines, then the nation declines. And if the Sanatan Dharma was capable of perishing with the Sanatan Dharma it would perish. The Sanatan Dharma that is nationalism.” </p>
      <p>India as a Rajasic nation is a future that is already happening. It is inevitable, it is preordained. And it is happening now.  </p>

      <h3>This 15th August marks the 151st birth anniversary of Sri Aurobindo. To commemorate this occasion, BluOne Ink is launching a seminal work on Sanatan Dharma by Partho</h3>
      <p>Partho’s book, This is Sanatan Dharma, ( एष धर्म: सनातन: )— The Quest for Truth will be consecrated to the Mother and Sri Aurobindo on 3rd August at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Delhi Branch, and launched nationally on 17th August at the Vivekananda International Foundation.</p>
      <p>Quoting from the blurb of the book— “We speak often of the Hindu religion, of the Sanatan Dharma, but few of us really know what that religion is…This is the Dharma that for the salvation of humanity was cherished in the seclusion of this peninsula from of old. It is to give this religion that India is rising. She does not rise as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, to trample on the weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted to her over the world. India has always existed for humanity and not for herself and it is for humanity and not for herself that she must be great.”</p>
      <p>These are the words of Maharishi Sri Aurobindo. But what is this Sanatan Dharma? Is it just the religion and rituals that Hindus follow or is it really the secret of life and consciousness that is embedded in the very fabric of our cosmic existence? This book reveals, layer by layer, the subtler spiritual dimensions of Sanatan Dharma, and its timeless relevance to human existence and civilization.</p>
      <p>‘This book was written’, says the author in the preface of the book, ‘as a series of reflective notes on Sanatan Dharma from the vedantic perspective, highlighting some of the foundational vedantic concepts of the Dharma. My intention in writing this book was not to provide an exhaustive or encyclopedic span of the Dharma but only to draw some of its broad contours. The Sanatan Dharma, as I have maintained throughout this book, is vedantic in conception but yogic in practice—and this is precisely my leitmotif through the book.</p>
      <p>‘There is, of course, much more to Sanatan Dharma than its vedantism, and not all of Sanatan Dharma is vedantic, there is much in it that is dualistic, monistic, even theistic, agnostic and atheistic; there are also pervasive elements of the religious, the symbolic and the ritualistic, as there are of the purely contemplative—but then all of these seemingly disparate elements can be beautifully subsumed and integrated within the overarching vedantic worldview. Once the underlying vedanta of Sanatan Dharma is understood, almost all its other aspects—metaphysical or practical—can be easily understood in that context.’</p>
      <p>We look forward to the national release of this book which, to quote Sri Gautam Chikermane, nationally renowned author and scholar, explores the Sanatan Dharma and fulfills a vacuum in the world of ideas, and makes it an essential conversation of the time.</p>

      <h3>To mark the 151st birth anniversary of Sri Aurobindo, BluOne Ink is launching a new and insightful biography of the great revolutionary and Rishi, Sri Aurobindo on 15th August in India and France. Here is an excerpt from the book by Luc Venet.</h3>
      <p>The first of January 1908 in the morning, the train bringing Aurobindo and Barin back from Surat entered Baroda station.</p>
      <p>Friends, students and many unknown well-wishers awaited Aurobindo as he stepped out of his compartment. The young men clutched the carriage transporting the two brothers and escorted them to the residence of Khaserao Jadhav.</p>
      <p>A visitor was awaiting them: Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Yogi whom Barin had met while searching for a master to chaperone his project of warrior monks. Lele was a simple civil servant, but his eyes glowed with the evidence of an inner life.</p>
      <p>Aurobindo informed him about his practice of pranayama and the results he had attained until everything had stopped. Lele suggested that he should suspend all his outer activities and join him in meditation.</p>
      <p>Aurobindo accepted, but not before reporting on the Surat events to the packed crowd of well-wishers camping on the lawns outside Khaserao’s house. Then he made a courtesy call to his former employer, the Maharajah.</p>
      <p>Finally, he joined Lele in a friend’s townhouse and there, in a small room at the top, the two men sat facing each other on the floor.</p>
      <p>‘Sit in meditation,’ he said, ‘but do not think, look only at your mind; you will see thoughts coming into it; before they can enter, throw them away from you till your mind is capable of entire silence.’ I had never heard before of thoughts coming visibly into the mind from outside, but I did not think of either questioning the truth or the possibility, I simply sat down and did it. In a moment my mind became silent as a windless air on a high mountain summit and then I saw a thought and then another thought coming in a concrete way from outside; I flung them away before they could enter and take hold of the brain and in three days I was free.</p>
      <p>These three days of meditation with Lele would provoke a radical change of consciousness. Ordinary reality had been abolished in what the Upanishads call the consciousness of the silent Brahman, and which Buddhism calls Nirvana. Years later, Aurobindo attempted to put words on this new sensory revelation. </p>
      <p>It threw me suddenly into a condition above and without thought, unstained by any mental or vital movement; there was no ego, no real world–only when one looked through the immobile senses, something perceived or bore upon its sheer silence a world of empty forms, materialized shadows without true substance. There was no One or many even, only just absolutely That, featureless, relationless, sheer, indescribable, unthinkable, absolute, yet supremely real and solely real. This was no mental realization nor something glimpsed somewhere above,–no abstraction–it was positive, the only positive reality–although not a spatial physical world, pervading, occupying or rather flooding and drowning this semblance of a physical world, leaving no room or space for any reality but itself, allowing nothing else to seem at all actual, positive or substantial. </p>
      <p>After those three days, Aurobindo returned to his friends at Khaserao Jadhav’s residence. He noticed that the silence endured effortlessly in him.</p>

      "content": `
      <div class="blog-content">
      <h3>The Matri Mandir, designed, inspired and guided through its construction by the Mother of Pondicherry Ashram, stands as a profoundly evocative symbol of a new age of truth consciousness on earth.</h3>
      <p>The Matrimandir is a subject that I have been interested in for a very long time. Way back in 1987—I had just discovered the Mother and Sri Aurobindo—I came upon two intensely fascinating books that were to change my whole way of thinking. Satprem’s Adventure of Consciousness, and Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet’s The New Way. While Satprem gently guided me into the Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, Norelli-Bachelet revealed to me the occult dimensions of the Matri Mandir—the Mother’s Temple—at Auroville. I had never visited Auroville, so had no idea of the Matri Mandir. But the moment I saw the image of the crystal on the cover of the book, I was as if pulled into a vortex. In a flash, Sri Aurobindo’s Yoga, almost wholly abstract for me till then, morphed into the compelling image of a giant crystal sitting upon Sri Aurobindo’s symbol.</p>
      <p>Norelli-Bachelet’s The New Way involves a lot of sacred geometry and architecture, esoteric numerology and symbology. It is rich, complex, challenging, mystifying. I know very few people who have gone through it all. Many have dismissed it as new-age mumbo jumbo with very little real mathematics—which is sad, because there’s so much to discover in the book, hidden in all that geometry and esotericism. Fortunately, I was not distracted by Norelli-Bachelet’s numerological-astrological theories and constructs: I was taken straightaway through a fascinating rabbit hole into something far more interesting and challenging: an entirely new way of looking at the physical world, as if every physical structure and event concealed, in plain sight, subtler layers of significances and meanings, as if everything everywhere has a hidden, an occult, significance. This physical world is not physical at all but symbolical. Everything—events, incidents, structures, movements—is a symbol of something that is behind. This universe itself is a symbol of something else, something behind it all, subtler, deeper, perhaps truer. Who knows?</p>
      <p>Have you seen the movie Contact? Judy Foster as Eleanor Arroway? I use this movie to explain what I feel the Matrimandir is. This science-fiction movie is based on a novel written by Carl Sagan, a mainstream scientist. There are certain movies and books, the Mother once said, which are inspired by a higher consciousness, they don’t come from the mental plane and the author just ‘receives’ the story. And I think that this movie is one of those. It is about contact with an extra-terrestrial civilization, about receiving detailed mathematical instructions to build a machine whose purpose no one knows till the machine is built and a person is put into it. It is then that the purpose of the machine is revealed but only to the person inside it. It is a machine to transport a human being to almost the other side of the galaxy through a wormhole, an <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wormhole-tunnels-in-spacetime-may-be-possible-new-research-suggests/" target="_blank">Einstein-Rosen bridge,</a> in a matter of a few minutes, a journey that would be almost impossible in normal physical spacetime.</p>
      <p>This was my first intuition about the Matrimandir: what if the Matri Mandir were some kind of a “consciousness device” whose true purpose we wouldn’t know until we ourselves were, in some intimate way, inside it?</p>
      <p>Perhaps the Matri Mandir is an occult consciousness device which intensifies consciousness, creates a field of concentration, which perhaps opens up a passage to the Supramental? Almost a concentrated consciousness field which would warp spacetime, just as gravity; something that connects our earth to the gnostic spheres, that serves as a bridge or a tunnel going right through all the resistances of terrestrial nature. Because if it were not so, just as it would take years to physically travel through spacetime to another galaxy, it will also take centuries to pass through this whole mass of human, terrestrial resistance.</p>
      <p>Let’s not take this lightly. This kind of resistance in matter is what compelled beings like Mother and Sri Aurobindo to give up their bodies. As Mother said after Sri Aurobindo’s passing that Sri Aurobindo had sacrificed his body because of the resistance of human nature; it was his plunge into the very Inconscience, the plunge of the Light into the dark to destroy the resistance once for all. That was a huge sacrifice. So, some possibility of another kind of intervention is needed, a possibility that needs to be planted on this planet. I think that this is one of the inner purposes of the Matrimandir.</p>
      <p>The Matrimandir, and especially the Inner Chamber, may be the “device” that intensifies consciousness. And the crystal is not just symbolic, it must have an occult significance too. The Mother associated transparency with sincerity, the transparency of the psychic. On the occult plane, may the crystal not be the “crystallization” of the psychic? I have a deep intuition that the crystal holds something of the Mother’s spiritual and supramental Force, that Force which she first infused into the pillars. This is a crystallization of the kind of consciousness needed to accelerate the Supramental process, to pull down and fix in a physical structure the vibrations of the Supramental. And then the vibrations can be received directly by anyone tuned into that frequency.</p>
      <p>This is perhaps why the Mother insisted on concentration—not meditation, worship, or anything like that, only pure concentration. In my understanding, the kind of concentration that is demanded in the Inner Chamber is not the concentration on something . You cannot concentrate on a crystal or a ray of light unless you do it in a symbolic sense, or you use the symbol as the medium of the concentration. The ray is physical, but also symbolic of the unseen Supramental Sun. So what is it that you are going to concentrate on, really?</p>
      <p>Concentration, in a way, is self-annulment. It is the kind of concentration that most of us don’t know because our concentration is so used to being a concentration on some object, idea, vision, or something. It is a concentration with object, whereas in the Matrimandir we are talking about a concentration which is without object or subject, something  that happens when self is annulled, when you have stepped back from name and form.</p>
      <p>It is in that state of concentration that you realize the nature of the Matrimandir. The Matrimandir is not supposed to be outside at all. What you see outside is a structure. But when you are at that right frequency—or intensity—of concentration, the structure which is outside simply transfers itself to the inside. And you find that you are not in the Inner Chamber: you are the Inner Chamber. Your very concentration is the crystal. You are connected twenty-four hours, moment to moment, with that one ray of Light that is connecting you with the Sahasrara and working right down to your Muladhara. And suddenly that entire crystal thing is your occult body, and you grasp in a single moment the entire significance of something that is still not a reality of our mental-sensorial plane—a reality of tomorrow, perhaps.</p>
      <p>For me, that is the real purpose and the real meaning of the Matrimandir. To open to a higher reality, a reality that will shape the future of the human species. But how does it work in the here and now? Is it shaping our future even in the present, as we live it day to day?</p>
      <p>There are various layers of the Matrimandir’s effect, or impact. The ‘effect’ of the Matrimandir will vary with the consciousness it affects. Whatever bhava or inner attitude a person goes in with, he or she comes out with a certain inner response, a certain subtle inner shift which will reveal itself according to the bhava, or the inner opening. The effect will be proportionate to the depth or height of consciousness of the being who is in contact with it. There is no way one can say this is the only way it will work.</p>
      <p>Going back to sacred architecture—the Matrimandir seems to be built along certain definitive occult lines of transmission of Force, or Shakti, and a kind of a secret passage to the future. If you look deep enough, you will see the future, perhaps still concealed in symbol. But the symbol here is not the pillar or the petal or the crystal— the entire structure is the symbol. The whole of Matrimandir is the symbol. Once you intuit, or sense, the symbol, the symbol and the symbolized become one dynamic experience, and everything then becomes part of that dynamic experience, even the number play, the geometry, the design. Everything.</p>
      <p>Every detail that has gone into the design has a significance, but the significances are revealed only when you have caught hold of the underlying symbolism, the underlying patterns. It is like the machine in Contact —everything is there, all the parts are there, the whole structure is there, but you cannot see what it is, the dots do not connect yet. Why is everything placed exactly the way they are placed? Does the spiral path leading up to the chamber mean something? What is the significance of the chambers themselves? And the pillars? Why twelve? And knowing something about the original design, the one given by the Mother, you also see what is not there, what was supposed to be there but is not, and even that resonates with the whole. You begin to see not just the physical architecture but a mathematical architecture as well; and something still deeper, more intricate, subtler, almost like poetry in matter.</p>
      <p>And then the very location of Matrimandir. What is the significance of the geographical location of it? There must be a significance. I often think of the Mother’s statement that India is the psychic centre of the world. And might Auroville have a significant place in the subtle body of India? We all know the story: the Mother was looking for the exact location of the future Auroville. And she was taken to several places. But when she was brought to the location where the Matrimandir now stands, she said, “This is it.” There must be some significance here, something still to be understood—some relation between that location and what we call the terrestrial body of the earth.</p>
      <p>I am not very sure that these questions that arise in us, and the answers, insights, intuitions that come in response, are meant to be shared. There are certain things which have to be self-revealed. The truth and the significance of certain things are to be understood or intuited in our inmost consciousness, when we are ripe enough to receive the knowledge.</p>
      <p>I feel that the Matrimandir reveals itself in consciousness. I don’t think anyone will be able to explain the Matrimandir, and I don’t think that anyone is supposed to either. This is how it seems it is meant to be. And the more one understands the Matrimandir, the more one realizes that it is not meant to be explained. In fact, in a certain way, I don’t think it is even meant to be understood. There are several facets that do come together, some of the pieces of the puzzle do fall into place, but not all of it ever falls into place. And one cannot mentally synthesize this whole knowledge—at our level, I don’t think it is possible. So one just has to wait for for the revelations, the intuitions.</p>
      <p>The Mother had the whole Matrimandir in her vision. It seems more and more to be some kind of a material extension of her body, or at least some kind of an emanation in matter, something that would extend her consciousness into a visible and tangible form, a material means of connecting to the Future. Recall the central symbolism—the Matrimandir, the new consciousness, arising out of earth, materially.</p>
      <p>The mandir, even traditionally, was not really meant to be exclusively a place of worship, it was meant to be the materialization of the Divine, the Divine actually crystallizing itself in matter, assuming material form. That has always been the true occult purpose of a temple, a mandir, in India. This is the reason the architecture of mandirs was also very specific. One couldn’t construct a mandir any way one wanted. There was a certain architectural and geometrical norm that had to be strictly followed.</p>
      <p>The primary installation of the Divine in a mandir was not even in the idol. The idol was used just as a point of reference because you needed a physical reference. But behind that it was establishing the Presence itself. The idol, the murti, was just a point of reference for the establishment— sthapana —of the Presence in matter, in material space. There is a lot of occult symbology in temple architecture, and the Matrimandir is not just another temple but a temple which I think is the prototype of the future temple, a temple to connect to the Supramental.</p>

      <p>From the Upanishads</p>
      <p>Janak is widely known as the the King-philosopher of ancient India. He was a Rishi, a Seer, as well as a noble and accomplished king. His court was famous for patronizing philosophers, sages and poets. He used to hold debates on philosophy and dharma. These were known as shastrarthas. Leading scholars, young and old, were invited to these shashtrarthas.</p>
      <p>Janak himself was an ardent thinker and had a deep yearning for knowledge. But, in spite of all his knowledge, he lacked the spiritual wisdom and so became increasingly arrogant as his knowledge grew. However, he was perhaps aware of this deficiency in him and so his deepest aspiration was to meet a spiritually realized being, a sage, who would consent to be his Guru and lead him to perfection. He met countless sages but never did he meet the one he was awaiting.</p>
      <p>One day, it so happened, that the Sage Ashtavakra, known as much for his profound wisdom as for his physical deformities, was visiting Janak’s kingdom. He heard about a shastrarth that was being conducted by King Janak, and so he reached the palace and entered the court of King Janak.</p>
      <p>As he entered, the courtiers and scholars present there looked up at him and could not suppress their emotions as they saw the deformed young boy walking into the court. The name Ashtavakra itself meant eight bends or deformities in the body. The story goes that Ashtavakra was cursed by his father while he was still in the womb, and so was born deformed.</p>
      <p>Some felt pity, some a bit of horror, and some laughed out in obvious derision. Ashtavakra remained calm as he looked around the assembly. And then he spoke in a voice clear and sharp: “I thought I had come into the company of wise men! Isn’t this King Janak’s court? But I only see cobblers here — for you see only my skin and try to assess me, even as a cobbler assesses quality by seeing the skin! Know you not that a river may run a crooked course but never the water?”</p>
      <p>As the words rang out loud and clear, all the courtiers and guests fell silent, embarrassed by their own action.</p>
      <p>The King himself stood up and did his namaskara to the young stranger.</p>
      <p>“I see force in your bearing, young man, and a power in your voice. There is also a calm in your eyes. I can sense a wisdom and light around you. Can you give me the highest knowledge?” The King asked his young guest.</p>
      <p>Ashtavakra said, “Yes, O King, I can.”</p>
      <p>Suddenly feeling inspired and confident, the King asked more directly: “Will you give me the knowledge of Brahman in the wink of an eye?”</p>
      <p>“Indeed,” replied Ashtavakra, “I will. But for that you have to give me Gurudakshina first!” Gurudakshina is the gift that the disciple gives to the Guru to repay him for all that he has gained at the feet of the Guru.</p>
      <p>“What is it that you would want, Sir?” Asked the King</p>
      <p>“Everything that you have,” replied Ashtavakra.</p>
      <p>In the presence of all the scholars and courtiers, King Janak immediately and unhesitatingly agreed.</p>
      <p>“Your throne and kingdom, first, O Janak!” Said Ashtavakra.</p>
      <p>Janak said quietly, “Yours, Noble Sir”</p>
      <p>Ashtavakra then asked Janak to leave his throne and sit amongst the courtiers and scholars as the throne no longer belonged to him. Janak quietly obeyed.</p>
      <p>Then Ashtavakra said, “Cease all your planning and thinking about your kingdom for it is no longer yours.”</p>
      <p>Janak threw out all his planning and scheming and sat still, his mind empty. Ashtavakra then asked Janak to drop the body awareness — “Your body is no longer yours, Janak. Drop your identification with it!”</p>
      <p>Next Ashtavakra asked Janak to give up all thoughts, for the mind, and all its activities, were not his anymore. In the proximity of a realized Guru, Janak could empty his whole consciousness and become utterly still in mind and body. In a trice, the realization of the Self came upon him.</p>
      <p>Janak, enlightened, bowed deeply before Ashtavakra, the great rishi who had given him the knowledge of Self in “the wink of an eye”.</p>
      <p>Ashtavakra then asked the King to return to the throne, saying: “O King, now rule your kingdom as a custodian, a trustee, for you are now free of all ownership and doership. Live your life as a witness, for you are free of all identification.”</p>
      <p>And so it came to pass that Janak became one of the legendary Sage-kings of ancient India.</p>
      <p>Even the highest knowledge can come to one who is willing to give up his all in a single moment if asked by the Guru. The Guru’s Presence and Grace are inestimable in one’s spiritual quest.</p>

      <div class="blog-content">
      <p>India is an ancient civilization. In fact, it is the only civilization that has survived unbroken, and essentially unchanged, for nearly five thousand years. Much more than a nation, as understood in our modern geopolitical sense, India is a civilization arisen from a wide and profound quest for the deepest truths of human existence.</p>
      <p>Most civilizations in history have centered their existence around economic growth and geopolitical expansion. The Indian civilization has always been centered around the human quest for Truth, Knowledge and Immortality —  satyam, jnanam, amritam.</p>
      <p>No other civilization we know of has pursued such a quest for Knowledge and Immortality with such relentless zeal. The Indian psyche, in its most essential sense, has been historically preoccupied with the philosophical and spiritual quest for Truth. In the early formative years of the Indian civilization and what may be called the Indian spiritual philosophy (darshan), the Indian mind had intuitively grasped that all existence is one indivisible continuous reality manifesting in all form and movement — the seed of the great philosophical system of Advaita Vedanta.</p>
      <p>Vedanta continues to this day an unbroken and unmodified psycho-spiritual tradition of self-enquiry and self-realization. The sciences, the mathematics, the arts, the poetry and literature, the mythology and the several religions that spread across the spectrum of Indian civilization all blossomed, in one way or another, from the seed of advaita Vedanta.</p>
      <p>Vedanta is also the base for Sanatan Dharma, the eternal Law of being, which is the core of what is widely known as the Hindu religion. Sanatan is eternal and universal — not subject to time, circumstances and change, nor limited to a particular geography, society or ideology; and dharma is the binding Law, the principle of being, without which a thing or a being would cease to exist as an independent or autonomous entity.</p>
      <p>Sanatan Dharma is not religion in the popular sense of the word. It is not a philosophical or ethical system to be “practiced”, though several philosophical and ethical systems have arisen from Sanatan Dharma. In itself and in its purity, Sanatan Dharma is the quest for the perfect Truth of being, Satyam, and its perfect manifestation and expression in living, Ritam. Satyam and Ritam therefore constitute the true basis and practice of Sanatan Dharma. And it must be noted that Satyam  and Ritam are not philosophical, cultural or ethical concepts but truths to be realized and lived in the most mundane and practical sense.</p>
      <p>The realization of Satyam, Truth of being, and Ritam, Truth in becoming, are the twin foundations of Sanatan Dharma and Sanatan life. Without these, there can be no Sanatan Dharma or Sanatan life. This is a fundamental condition.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the realization of Truth (of being and in becoming) is the primary business of Sanatan Dharma, and all that can be thought and said of Sanatan Dharma must be in accordance with this, and must always refer back to this.</p>
      <p>In this sense, Sanatan Dharma cannot possibly belong to a particular culture or community. It is in this sense that Sanatan Dharma may be regarded as the base of Hinduism but not Hinduism itself. And equally, in this sense, Sanatan Dharma may be regarded as the true basis of any human religion.</p>
      <p>If we were to translate the original language in which Sanatan Dharma was first articulated into the English language, for instance, we would find no trace of any religious or cultural narrative in Sanatan Dharma at all. The phrase Sanatan Dharma  itself would translate into Eternal Law or Principle. Taken out of its traditional Sanskritic settings, Sanatan Dharma could be perfectly expressed in completely secular and scientific language and understood in any human context.</p>
      <p>Sanatan thought is free of the idea of a single or only God or a single and definitive Scripture. In fact, there is not even the idea of God as the primary or ultimate being. Being itself is primary and ultimate and does not need a “God” to complete it. If one searches for a name of a Supreme God in Sanatan philosophy, one will find none. What one will find is the Sanskrit phrase Sat-Chit-Anand (usually written as a single word Satchidananda or Sacchidananda) as the ultimate description of Reality. Sat  means Existence, Truth, or Reality; Chit refers to consciousness; Ananda means bliss, or the bliss of perfect fulfillment.</p>
      <p>This ‘perfect fulfillment’, is the flowering of the realization of oneself as Satchidananda, and is the peak realization of Sanatan Dharma, out of which all life and living, all values and rules, all relations and standards of conduct arise naturally and seamlessly. There is therefore no divine reality or truth out there, outside of oneself. All truth and reality, human or divine, is within. There are no heavens beyond: the within is the only heaven.</p>
      <p>There is no one scripture or teaching that tells one how to come to this fulfillment. There are many ways to come to it and none of the ways can be prescribed or described. Each one who wishes to come to this realization must find his or her own way. There is no priestly class or specific group of people appointed to lead the seeker towards this realization. There are facilitators, teachers, guides for sure, but the realization itself is accessible to any one who really wants it. With or without teachers and guides.</p>
      <p>This is the beauty of what we describe as the Sanatan dharma.</p>
      <p>धार्यते इति धर्म​</p>
      <p>That which upholds is Dharma</p>

      <p>True Yoga is always a work on one’s own nature</p>
      <p>Once, the great Yogi, Mahatapa, was meditating on Lord Shiva, absorbed in the inner rhythms of Om Namah Shivaya when a little bird flew overhead the great Yogi, dropping as it flew by. The Yogi felt the bird drop on his head and instantly came out of his meditation. Enraged, he cursed the bird for the dropping, and lo! the little bird turned instantly to ash and dropped out of the sky. Such was the power of the Yogi’s penance.</p>
      <p>The great Yogi, somewhat impressed by his own Yogic powers, went into the nearby town to see what else he could do. He found his way to a small hut where he could see a woman serving food to her husband.</p>
      <p>Sage Mahatapa went up to the gate and begged for food, as was customary for monks and saints. “Annam dehi,” he called out to the woman.</p>
      <p>The woman bowed low to the Sage and said, “Please wait, my Lord! Let me finish serving food to my husband.”</p>
      <p>Mahatapa was, at the best of times, an impatient person. Though Yoga can give knowledge, realizations and powers but it does not necessarily change the fundamental nature of the Yogi. Mahatapa, following the impulsion of his nature, lost his temper and almost growled at the woman — “Are you asking me to wait, Woman?”</p>
      <p>The woman smiled indulgently at the Sage and said softly, “I am not a poor little bird that you can curse and kill, O Sage!”</p>
      <p>Mahatapa was taken aback. How could this poor woman know about the bird? The woman smiled again, as if reading the Sage’s mind. She said, “O Sage, Yoga is not the only way to acquire siddhis! I practice no Yoga, but I have Bhakti. I serve my husband as I serve Vishnu himself. My service is my meditation and my worship.”</p>
      <p>Sage Mahatapa understood that he was in the presence of an accomplished Yogi, and felt ashamed of his own impatience and anger. He bowed before her and asked her humbly, “I wish to learn further, deepen my practice, conquer my nature… Can you help?”</p>
      <p>The woman replied, “My Lord, I am not a teacher, I live the life of a housewife. It is not my dharma to instruct. But I can send you to one who is higher than I in learning and realization, a great master.”</p>
      <p>“Then direct me to him, I shall be deeply grateful, Didi!”</p>
      <p>“Then go to Mithilapuri town, O Sage, and meet Dharmavyada..”</p>
      <p>So the Sage went to Mithilapuri and sought out Dharmavyada. He was in for a slightly rude shock when he discovered that Dharmavyada was a butcher by profession. ‘A butcher?’, he thought to himself, ‘What will a worldly man like this butcher teach me of Yoga?’ But out of respect for the woman who had guided him here, he went up to the butcher and stood respectfully before his shop. The butcher was busy cutting and carving the meat. As Mahatapa stood by and watched, he couldn’t help noticing how perfectly the butcher was working on the meat. Each movement was almost perfectly measured, graceful, efficient. The butcher’s face was calm and radiated peace and contentment. His eyes were unwaveringly fixed on the meat, knife and stone.</p>
      <p>After a while, the butcher Dharmavyada stopped his work, wiped his hands, and bowed to the Sage Mahatapa.</p>
      <p>“Welcome, O Sage!”</p>
      <p>Mahatapa bowed too and began, “Sir, I was sent by…”</p>
      <p>Dharmavyada stopped him short, “I know, Sage. You have been sent by a great sage herself, one who has done intense penance and has accomplished much. You are fortunate to have met her.”</p>
      <p>“She mentioned nothing…” Said Mahatapa.</p>
      <p>Dharmavyada smiled, “You have acquired the power to reduce a bird to ashes with your anger. She possesses the power to protect the bird from a Yogi’s anger!”</p>
      <p>Mahatapa was truly astounded. Dharamvyada continued, “And your question, how can a worldly man like me, a crude butcher, teach you Yoga, reveals that you still have not conquered the dualities of your mind, O Sage!”</p>
      <p>The Sage bowed low and said, “Teach me, O Master! I see the limitations of my sadhana and how much more I still need to grow.”</p>
      <p>And Dharamvyada said, “I shall, O Mahatapa.. once I finish my work and close my shop. You can come home with me and we will talk..”</p>
      <p>And the Sage saw, out of the corner of his eye, a little bird fly across the sky.</p>

      "title": "Hindus, Halal And Political Correctness",

      "author": "BluOne Ink",
      "content": `
      <div class="blog-content">
      <p>Halal is an Arabic word that indicates what is allowed or permitted. A practising Muslim’s life is regulated by what is Halal and what is Haram (forbidden or prohibited). Naturally, these permissions and prohibitions extend to food. That is why the slogan of a famous Indian food delivery start-up and restaurant aggregator that “food has no religion” does not make any sense. In fact, much of what we eat is theologically, ritually and culturally coded.</p>
      <p>No wonder, last year a furious controversy broke out on social media over the popular American fast food chain McDonald’s serving only Halal meat products in India. In response to a customer query, the restaurant chain confirmed, “All our restaurants have HALAL certificates. You can ask the respective restaurant Managers to show you the certificate for your satisfaction and confirmation.”</p>
      <p>This triggered a debate over whether all customers, regardless of their religious beliefs or persuasions, ought to be forced to eat Halal products. Left-Liberals were quick to react. Shabnam Hashmi of Sahmat told Al Jazeera, “It is an absolutely Islamophobic atmosphere which is existing in India now and each and every occasion is used by right-wing Hindus to attack Muslims.” Many Hindus agreed. They couldn’t care less what kind of meat they ate. Whether the animal they were consuming was slaughtered by Jhatka or Halal didn’t matter.</p>
      <p>But this attitude of indifference, stemming from a combination of ignorance and political correctness, can go against the very civil liberties and freedoms that we cherish and are committed to uphold. Let us, for a moment, consider what happens when a devout Sikh enters a Halal-certified McDonald’s restaurant and proceeds to order a McChicken Burger. If she follows the Rahit Maryada, she is forbidden to eat Halal meat. She must leave the restaurant or risk violating the tenets of her faith.</p>
      <p>A Hindu meat-eater, even if not expressly prohibited from partaking of Halal meat, does not have a choice in a restaurant serving only Halal meat. She cannot avail of “Jhatka” meat from an animal slaughtered by a single swift stroke, as per the normal Hindu practice. What is more, she may not know that only meat from animals slaughtered by Muslim butchers is considered Halal. The butcher, in addition, must recite verses from the Koran before the slaughter. The animal is allowed to bleed to death, which according to some animal rights activists is cruel and painful.</p>
      <p>Halal meat is consecrated by a prayer to Allah. According to a truly liberal, Sanatani outlook, meat sanctified in the name of Allah would not, per se, be offensive or problematic. However, that would only work if both Hindus and Muslims actually believed, after Mahatma Gandhi, that “Ishwar Allah tero naam”. But if that were indeed the case, what would be the need for Halal certification in the first place? Muslims would also not object to receiving sanctified food from Hindu temples. Alas, the world we live in is not yet informed by such lofty ideals. The truth is that Halal meat puts non-Muslim butchers out of work. It also results in a gradual monopoly of Muslims over the meat business.</p>
      <p>Currently in India, only the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) certification is required on edible products. The FSSAI was set up in 2011 as an autonomous body under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. As such, Halal certification is not compulsory. But in order not to offend a minority of paying customers in India, many restaurant chains, government establishments and even airlines serve only Halal meat. If they gave non-Muslim customers a choice, there would be no problem. But quite often, meat eaters are forced to eat only Halal products. That way, non-Muslims end up, without quite having an option, supporting the Islamisation of food and also contributing to a reduction of their own food choices.</p>
      <p>When I lived in Singapore, I found Halal ubiquitous even in a professedly secular, Muslim minority country. In college and university canteens, food courts and roadside eateries, even unwashed dishes were separated on the basis of Halal. As a vegetarian, I once put my used plates on a Halal dishwashing counter. A Singaporean Malay lady worker quickly admonished me, “Over there, la, you’re not Muslim, no?” I didn’t want to argue with her that all vegetarian food was automatically Halal. In the end, all restaurants are forced into the Halal or non-Halal category. The majority Chinese, evidently, belonged to the latter; they have the fewest food restrictions. The rest, Indian or Western, vegetarian or non-vegetarian, as a matter of course, opt for Halal certification.</p>
      <p>In India, there are several bodies that can certify a product or establishment Halal compliant, for a price, of course. Many have created attractive websites promising a window of business opportunities to prospective clients including access to the estimated 2.5 billion Muslims worldwide. The Indian Halal Certification Board proudly announces that it is affiliated to Sharia councils and Islamic organisations across 120 countries. One website brags that the profits via Halal will easily offset the certification fees. The cherry on the Halal icing is that such products can continue to cater to non-Muslims.</p>
      <p>This is where the Halal controversy takes a more serious turn. The success of Halal certification needs the support not only of Muslims for whom this is a religious obligation, but also of non-objecting non-Muslims. Gradually, even a small Halal-requiring percentage of consumers can compel more and more companies to pay up for Halal certification. This has been likened by the critics of Halalonomic coercion to jazia, the “infidel” tax that non-Muslims had to pay in an Islamic state just for not being Muslim.</p>
      <p>If Hindus don’t mind Halal while Muslims insist on it, what happens? Everyone ends up conforming to Halal coercion. This, to conscientious objectors of Halal, is the tyranny of the minority in which “the most intolerant wins” as explained in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Skin in the Game. If we don’t take countermeasures, it is only a matter of time before Halal cosmetics, couture, films, literature, even hospitals and housing complexes, as one near Kochi so proudly and openly advertises itself, will be thrust upon us.</p>

      <i><p>The Sanatani is an open system. That does not mean it is a one-way stream, with people leaving the Hindu fold … It means those who left can also return. Whenever they like.</p></i>
      <p>Is Hinduism locked in an existential struggle against Abrahamic faiths, especially Islam and Christianity? Not necessarily. As I have argued in my earlier writings, particularly Altered Destinations: Self, Society, and Nation in India (London, 2010) and Making India: Colonialism, National Culture, and the Afterlife of Indian English Authority (Dordrecht, 2013), the Sanatani and the non-Sanatani can coexist without conflict.</p>
      <p>That is because the Sanatani, with its inclusive and open-ended belief systems, has the capacity both to absorb and allow radical differences. Also, and this is something we tend to forget, non-Sanatani systems, religious or secular, also have Sanatani elements of pluralism, non-exclusion, and acceptance of difference.</p>
      <p>The real problem occurs when the non-Sanatani becomes anti-Sanatani. This can be true of theologically justified armed invasion and occupation as applicable to much of the Islamic conquest of India. Or, on a smaller scale, of the Portuguese assault and inquisition in Cochin and Goa, and the early French rule in Puducherry, where religious aggression accompanied imperialistic conquest.</p>
      <p>The British ruled differently, using a Macaulay-inspired educational, intellectual and cultural rebooting of India that, unfortunately, turned out to be anti-Sanatani in many of its features. Marxism and modernity, too, obviously non-Sanatani, can also be very viciously and virulently anti-Sanatani.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Dravidianist and Ambedkarite extremism, with their reverse racism, targeted hate campaigns and divisive politics, may also be included in the roster of anti-Sanatani movements. In more recent times, a combination of these forces have resulted in a rather powerful anti-India or, as some go to the extent of arguing, breaking-India narrative.</p>
      <p>What, then, would be the fitting response from the Sanatani side to such threats? The answer, rather obvious to those who have studied the Sanatana traditions, would be a principled and carefully executed combination of defence and offence. The defence, like a shield, protects us when we are most vulnerable; the sword thrusts, rather than slashes, where the adversary is at its weakest. But in the process, when the Sanatani dons the fierce mask that almost resembles its opposite, it must never lose its Sanatani essence, which remains plural, non-exclusive, open-ended. The Sanatani, after all, is exceptional precisely because it has no one point of origin, no one book or prophet, no one doctrine or ideology, no one church or belief system. Without origin or closure, the Sanatani permits a great variety of both precepts and practices with some fundamental underlying structures.</p>
      <p>In its fight against the anti-Sanatani, if the Sanatani becomes indistinguishable from its opponent, it would lose its self. Worse, the loss of the Sanatani, bad enough for itself, would also be catastrophic for the world. Whatever the symbol or deity of our battle against our adversaries, the more benign and sober form of it as well as ourselves must remain the normal and default mode.</p>
      <p>After all, a deity which is angry all the time, even the new and rather popular graphic of “angry Hanuman,” will eventually turn on its own followers, having run out of enemies. Anger directed outward at real or imagined foes will come back to consume us too if we do not know the art of stilling it. Hence, all our rituals and ceremonies end with Shanti Mantras. Energies invoked for specific purposes must also be stilled and quietened for cosmic balance and harmony to be restored.</p>
      <p>It is in this light that we must view the “ghar wapasi” of nearly 300 so-called Muslims of Haryana to Hinduism in two recent instances. The earlier one occurred on April 18, when six families with some 35 members returned to Hinduism in Danoda Kalan, a village in the district of Jind in Haryana. The more recent incidence was on May 8 in which 40 families consisting of some 250 people returned to Hinduism.</p>
      <p>In both instances, the trigger was the last rites of a deceased elder. By opting for cremation over burial, the reconverted returned to their Hindu identity. Earlier, I used “so-called Muslim” to describe these families because they lived like Hindus, for most part retaining Hindu customs and names, but were listed as Muslims. According to their own traditions and legends, they were converted to Islam during the times of Aurangzeb. One reason for their return, it was reported, is that they belong to the Dom community, recognised as a scheduled caste, and thus eligible for benefits if they identified as Hindus rather than Muslims.</p>
      <p>It is very important to underline that what these two cases illustrate is the basic and brutal fact that most Indian Muslims were once Hindus or people of indigenous faith practices. The road to their return to the Hindu fold should not only be wide open but underwritten with security, dignity, acceptance and love. Without the first two, all “ghar wapasi” efforts will be futile.</p>
      <p>Once it is established that the return to Hinduism is as per the law, that is without fear or inducement, then both government and non-government agencies should ensure that such returnees are not harassed or hounded by the former co-religionists. After all, in several non-Sanatani religions, the price for apostasy is very high, as high, in fact, as death itself.</p>
      <p>The Sanatani, as I said earlier, is an open system. That does not mean that it is a one-way stream, with people leaving the Hindu fold to become Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Marxist or even secularist. It means that those who left can also return. Whenever they like. It is up to us, as modern Hindus, to make their return both meaningful and sustainable. We must create the felicity conditions for their welcome and integration into Hindu society.</p>
      <p>In this regard, it is a gross misunderstanding to claim that Hinduism is non-proselytising, though of course the word has a totally different connotation for us. The fact is that most of Vaishnavism, right up to the worldwide success of ISKCON, is based on attracting converts. There is no reason that should change now. If at all, Hinduism today should be made even more appealing to both returning and new converts.</p>

      <p>वेद महासागर हैं। सूक्ष्म व सघन ज्ञान के।  और यह ज्ञान का सागर पूरी मानवजाति की विरासत है।</p>
      <p>कदाचित वेद के वर्णन का मेरे पास यही सबसे उत्तम रूपक है।  यह विशाल, बहुआयामी श्रुति जिसके बृहद दर्शन में सब कुछ समा जाता है। प्रत्येक क्षण इस सागर के रंग बदलते रहते हैं। गहन नील से हरित वर्ण, आसमानी से बैंगनी, नारंगी से सुनहरे। संध्या से प्रातः ऐसा लगता है इनके रंगों से उत्पन्न होते हैं।</p>
      <p>और प्रत्येक वर्ण जानने, समझने, अनुभव करने की विधा।</p>
      <p>एक सतरंगी प्रदर्शन है, इनका वाचन व उच्चारण। बहते हुए, फैलते हुए, प्रतिबिंबित रंग, जो सूर्य के प्रकाश का विस्फोट व तरंगें हैं।  चाहे उथली खाड़ियां हों, या तट पर सागर की उत्तल लहरें, चाहें अथाह गहराइयों में डुबकी लगाने का प्रयास हो या खुले क्षितिजहीन विस्तार में भ्रमण।</p>
      <p>और वेद स्वयं ही कई प्रकार के सागरों का बखान करते हैं। सलिलं अप्रकेतम अचेतन का सागर है जिससे जीवन का उद्विकास होता है। महो अर्णः हमारे मानस के ऊपर प्रकाश और ज्ञान का वह सागर है जिस तक हम सब योग द्वारा उठ सकते हैं। समुद्र से अर्थ है वह स्थान जहाँ सभी जल निकाय आकर मिलते हैं और सागर से भाव है बृहद और अनंत चित्त का जो वरुण देव का गुण है। समुद्र से तात्पर्य है परमात्मा के विराट अस्तित्व का इंगन और सरिताओं से अर्थ चित्त की व्यक्तिगत या विभिन्न रूपों में गति।</p>
      <p>ऐसा बहुत कुछ है जो हम समझ नहीं पाए। कितनी ही बार इन मन्त्रों को केवल रूढ़ि समझ कर तुच्छ मान लिया गया।  या मीमांसकों द्वारा इन्हें केवल कर्मकाण्ड बताया गया। या इनसे आर्यों के आक्रमण के सिद्धांत या ऐतिहासिक विवरण निकाले गए। ताकि हमें भान हो कि घोड़ों पर लैस आक्रांता किस प्रकार इस भूमि पर टिड्डियों की तरह पिल पड़े थे।</p>
      <p>किन्तु वेद तो सदा से हमारी दीवारों से ऊपर उठ कर सभी सीमाओं का अंत करते रहे हैं। चाहे वे सीमाएँ हमारे पूर्वाग्रहों की हों या नासमझी कीं।</p>
      <p>और सभी पंथ, दर्शन, धर्म, संस्कृतियाँ केवल उनमें बहती धाराएँ ही हैं।</p>
     <p>उस युग कीं जिसमें इन ऋकों की रचना हुई थी हमारे अचेतन के प्रतीकों का उद्भव हुआ था। वे प्रतीक आज भी हमारे आधुनिक जीवन में अनायास ही कहीं से भी प्रकट हो जाते हैं. शायद इसलिए कि वे हमारे सामूहिक अचेतन Collective Unconscious के छिपे आर्किटाइप Archetype या छिपे चिन्ह हैं। और वे हमारे चित्त में अस्तित्व के विज्ञान से प्रकट होते हैं।</p>
     <p>कम से कम तीन दशकों के अध्ययन के बाद मैं केवल विनम्रता से यह ही कह सकता हूँ। कि मैंने कठिनाई से इनके उथले तटों पर थोड़ी चहल कदमी की है। कुछ शंख इधर उधर से उठा लिए। और कुछ चित्र खींच लिए। किन्तु हर बार जब इनके ऊपर से कोई पर्दा गिरता है तो एक नई गहराई उजागर होती है। और केवल यह अचरज शेष रहता है कि अभी कितना कुछ समझना बाकी है।</p> 
     <p>ये कैसे कवि थे जिन्होंने काव्य और छंद का इतना परिमार्जन किया। प्रतीकों और मन्त्रों को एक संग जुटकर ऐसी विशाल संहिता की रचना करना महान उपलब्धि है जो शायद वेद के बाद इस स्तर पर किसी भी सभ्यता में संभव नहीं हो पाई।</p>
     <p>इस प्रकार के उच्चतम साहित्य की संरचना करना, जिसमें इस तरह अत्यंत ही विकसित लय और संकेतात्मकता का उपयोग किया गया हो दर्शाता है कि ऐसी कोई कुंजी उनके पास थी जिसे समझना हमारे लिए आवश्यक है। ऋषियों के अनुसार वेद अपौरुषेय हैं। इससे क्या अर्थ? कोई भी प्रत्येक महान साहित्य जब जन्म लेता है तो कवि या रचनाकार अदृश्य हो जाता है। किन्तु वेद में इस रचना की क्रिया को जागृत अवस्था में निरंतर रूप देने की विधि वैदिक ऋषियों ने हमें दी। और जब वे कहते हैं कि ये मन्त्र परम व्योम से आए हैं तो इससे भाव है मन से परे चित्त की उच्चतम अवस्था से जहाँ ऋषि या योगी अपनी आध्यात्मिक शक्ति से ऊपर उठ उन प्रकाश की तरंगों को देख या सुन पाते थे।  इसी श्रवण के कारण वेद को श्रुति का नाम दिया गया और इसी दर्शन के कारण ऋषि को मन्त्र दृष्टा कहा गया।</p>
     <p>आज भी हम उनकी दक्षता और प्रतिभा पर अचरज करते हैं। और आज भी उनके काव्य का उच्च अनुवाद हमसे दूसरी भाषाओँ में उस मूल स्तर पर संभव नहीं हो सका है। </p>

      <p>यज्ञ वेद का मुख्य प्रतीक है। यदि हम यज्ञ को इस भाव से समझेंगे तो वेद का अर्थ भी स्वतः प्रकट हो जाता है।</p>
      <p>यज्ञ वेद का मुख्य प्रतीक है। यह अस्तित्व की गहन समझ है जो हमारे पूर्वज ऋषियों ने सांकेतिक रूप में हमें दर्शाई। यह एक काव्यात्मक रहस्यमय यात्रा है जो मूल रूप से आध्यात्मिक है। यद्यपि इसे कई विवेचकों ने केवल रूढ़ि ही समझा, स्वामी दयानन्द व श्री अरविन्द ने इसके तीन स्तर हमें दिखाए। ये स्तर हैं आधिभौतिक, आधिदैविक व आध्यात्मिक।</p>
      <p>यदि हम अग्नि को हमारे हृदय के भीतर जलती सतत दिव्य ज्वाला के रूप में देखें, तो यज्ञ का अर्थ बदल जाता है। अग्नि चित्त का ध्यान हैं व तपस के देव हैं। स्वामी दयानंद ने इन्हें आत्मन व परमात्मन का वाची कहा है, अर्थात ये न केवल आत्मा व परमात्मा का प्रतिनिधित्व करते हैं ये उनके सत्य की उद्घोषणा भी करते हैं। अग्नि यज्ञ के प्रथम देव हैं। इसीलिए उन्हें पुरोहित कहा गया है। पुरतः अर्थात वह जो आगे या अग्र भाग में हो, पूर्व में हो। अर्थात अग्नि यज्ञ में अग्र रूप हैं जो साधक या ऋषि का अर्पण स्वीकार करते हैं।</p>
      <p>यज्ञ बली नहीं है। ना ही इससे भाव किसी प्रिय वस्तु का खोना है। बल्कि सब कुछ ईश्वरीय ज्योति में दान कर अपने निमित्त होने मात्र की स्वीकृति है। और यह दान ही सबसे बढ़ी प्राप्ति और पूर्णता है। और इसी धर्म में स्वयं का रूपांतरण है। स्वयं में जो भी विकृतियाँ हैं या असिद्धि है। उसे सत्य से युक्त कर उसका उत्थान है।</p>
      <p>हमारी परंपरा में यज्ञ को कर्मकांड माना गया है। किन्तु यदि हम इसकी गहराई में उतरें तो हमारे सभी कर्म परमात्मा के द्वारा ही अनूदित होते हैं। यदि हम कर्ता भाव त्याग कर जीवन को यज्ञ का निरूपण मान लें तो कभी कर्म वास्तव में योग में परिवर्तित हो जाते हैं।</p>
      <p>यज्ञ का निरुक्त देखें तो ज्ञात होगा कि इसके मूल अक्षर हैं य, ज्, व, ञ। य से भाव उठता है नियंत्रण का, स्वामित्व का, जैसे यम, यंत्र, आदि। ज से भावार्थ है शक्ति व रचना का जैसे जन्म, जनन, आदि। और अंत में न या ञ ध्वनि से अर्थ है वहन करना जैसे नयति, नति, आदि।</p>
      <p>यज्ञ से फिर अर्थ हुआ वे जो अधिष्ठ हैं। अध्यक्ष हैं। इसीलिए श्री अरविन्द ने कहा है कि यज्ञ द्योतक हैं विष्णु, शिव, योग, व धर्म के।</p>
      <p>किरीत जोशी कहते हैं कि यज्ञ आत्म समर्पण की क्रिया है। जिसमें अहम् का निषेध व अंत हो जाता है। और वैदिक देव इस यज्ञ में एक सत्य के विभिन्न रूप हैं।</p>
      <p>यज्ञ तपस्या हैं। साधना हैं। आराधना, शुद्धिकरण हैं। जिसमें अग्नि हृदय के इष्ट देव हैं, जो ईश्वर की अंश हैं। वे ही जीवात्मन हैं। हृदि पुरुष व चैत्य पुरुष हैं। वे ही चैत्य पुरूष (Psychic Being) हैं। यज्ञ का लक्ष्य फिर हुआ उस अग्नि को सशक्त करना, उसे और बढ़ाना और जीवन को यज्ञ में बदल देना।</p>
      <p>हृदय के भीतर स्थित आत्मन को सर्वव्यापी परमात्मन का अंश समझना और उनमें एकत्व देखना भक्ति व ईश्वर से प्रेम का मूल सिद्धांत है। और भारत के इतिहास में वैष्णव व शैव भक्ति के पंथ इसी दर्शन की उपज हैं। राधा व श्रीकृष्ण के अनंत प्रेम में भी इसी अनन्य एकात्म की पूर्ति मानी जा सकती है।</p>
      <p>यदि हम यज्ञ को इस भाव से समझेंगे तो वेद का अर्थ भी स्वतः प्रकट हो जाता है। और यज्ञ और योग में कोई अंतर नहीं, यह भी स्पष्ट हो जाता है।</p>

      <p>The Guru is a unique symbol and understanding of Indian spirituality. In no other culture is a seemingly-ordinary human being held with such reverence and devotion.</p>
      <p>The Guru is one who leads the student from darkness to light. Such is the literal meaning of the world. But what kind of light? It is not a physical or mental or emotional or pranic learning that the Teacher imparts but a spiritual transformation that yet encompasses all these in one sweep and curve.</p>
      <p>The Guru is the representative of the Divine on earth, nay, he or she is exalted as the Divine itself manifesting in form and name, as the vyakta roopa of the ineffable and eternal.</p>
      <p>In a famous doha, Kabir says that if given a choice between God and the Guru, he would bow before the Guru first for without the Guru he can never find God. There is a poetic truth in this verse but one might add that the Guru is God itself come here to guide and teach, to mentor and assist in one’s inner journey and explorations.</p>
      <p>And yet, there is no Guru but the Divine seated within. That is the final Guru, the true one, who once discovered is a sempiternal assurance of one’s spiritual destiny and fulfilment. It is in one’s heart that the true Teacher resides, the outer name and form of the Guru only the impetus and the assistance one needs to realize that the Divine is always within oneself, as oneself, in an evolution one calls yoga.</p>
      <p>Even so, the Guru in human form is seen as the reflection of one’s own higher self, as a mirror in the sky of one’s best and the true potential latent in each of us. It is the Guru that sustains us through all difficulties, who guides us and leads us through darkness and establishes in us the living certainty that one is in essence always pure, sacred, untouched and unharmed.</p>
      <p>The Guru imparts insights and understanding not just with verbal instructions but by his or her presence. Verily, sitting at the auspicious feet of the Master, one is enlightened without effort, if one learns how to just sit and imbibe spontaneously and with immediacy. Such is the import of the Sanskrit word ‘Upanishad’, one of the highest expressions of Vedanta in Indian spirituality.</p>
      <p>It is also true that the age of Guruvada might be over in modern times at least in the traditional sense. The ritualistic bending of one’s knee or bowing to the man in ochre is passé. Now the mind does not surrender so easily and needs more refined and nuanced understandings. Rare is the Guru who gives absolute freedom to the disciple and student to discover his or her own self, yet pours his quiet love and benediction upon them without expecting any return.</p>
      <p>There have been Gurus who have not only influenced a collection of disciples or a population but an age. Such Gurus capture the essence and the spirit of the times in their being and message. These are the jagat Gurus, the Teachers of teachers, who come at every significant cycle of human evolution and guide it with their vast and subtle influence.</p>
      <p>As one grows in yoga, love and adoration for the Guru grows spontaneously. This love is the secret for one’s future growth, the seed of one’s own divinity and the mentor and guide for all endeavors to come.</p>
      <p>To be one’s own light, atma deepo bhava, is an ancient dictum given us by the wisest of teachers; yet, this inner light is the same as the light of the being we call the Guru. The Guru can pour his or her energy into the disciple if necessary in a process called Shakti Paata; yet, the greatest imparting of strength and intensity to the disciple is not in terms of power but in terms of Truth and Consciousness and Bliss.</p>
      <p>This is the secret of the Guru: the Divine within and without, the formless taking a human form, the one who is our own self and nature calling us back to ourselves. To the Teacher the highest honor and the highest station with the clear awareness that there is no Self other than the Guru; nor is there a Guru other than the Self.</p>

      "content": `
      <div class="blog-content">
      <p>Hinduism is a myth. There is no religion such as Hinduism at least in the way we understand religion. It does not have one prophet, one set of unchanging beliefs or rituals, a single scripture, or any mandatory requirement.</p>
      <p>In fact, the word Hindu was used by Persians for the people who lived about the Sindhu or Indus river. If that is true, then it is only a local or regional tag.</p>
      <p>But if we go deeper into this so-called Hinduism, we will find all kinds of contradictory practices or beliefs, rituals, and denominations, that there might be only a few assertions made. That Hinduism is not a religion in the ordinary sense of the word. That a better word for it might be Sanatana Dharma, the Eternal Way, although the term has been abused lately by some zealots without understanding it fully. That the Rig Veda has influenced a large part of Sanatana Dharma and its various darsanas , although there may be exceptions with the so called anastika traditions. That the underlying theme of the Vedic way was a journey into the inner worlds. No other record of the time from any other part of the world describing such Mysteries exists. And, most importantly, that this inner journey, relentless and fearless, confirmed the underlying unity of the whole Universe in the strictest Monism ever articulated by mankind to this day.</p>
      <p>The term absolute monism is usually reserved for Advaita Vedanta, propagated by Adi Sankara. But absolute monism not only of the origin of things, but also their substance and essence, may be seen in all the Srutis. Perhaps a better term for this monism is non-dualism, what the word advaita truly means.</p>
      <p>So, the myth of Hinduism is that there is really no such thing as Hinduism if by that we mean a single religion. We may perhaps call it a way of seeing and being where the Many is One and the One is Many.</p>
      <p>It is due to this non-dualism taken to its completest understanding that we see the whole plethora of completely contradictory and opposite philosophies being taken as valid in the practices that form the corpus of Sanatana Dharma. And each individual is free to create and live his own. In a sense, this is completely liberating. And yet, it puts the entire responsibility on the individual to take the onus of his or her own understanding, development, refinement, and eventual direction. If this is understood, one can understand the confusion that one sees among even some of the most astute thinkers of our times.</p>
      <p>In his essay Is There an Indian Way of Thinking? An Informal Essay, published in Contributions to Indian Sociology (1989), A.K. Ramanujan complained of the trait of inconsistency in the Modern Indian way of life. And that modern Indian intellectuals “seemed to agree on one thing: the Indian trait of hypocrisy. Indians do not mean what they say, and say different things at different times.” And he wondered if they “may be using a different ‘logic’ altogether. Some thinkers believe that such logic is an earlier-stage of ‘cultural evolution’ and that Indians have not developed a notion of ‘data’, of objective facts.”</p>
      <p>And he quotes Sudhir Kakar, a psychoanalyst, to note that “Generally among Indians, there seems to be a different relationship to outside reality, compared to the one met with in the West. In India, it is closer to a certain stage in childhood when outer objects did not have a separate, independent existence but were intimately related to the self and its affective states…. The Indian ‘ego’ is underdeveloped; the world of magic and animistic thinking lie closer to the surface; so the grasp of reality is relatively tenuous.”</p>
      <p>He also noted a third trait to the inconsistency and ‘the apparent inability to distinguish self and non-self’ and that was ‘the extraordinary lack of universality’ among Indians. And he surmises that “Indian philosophers do not seem to make synoptic systems like Hegel’s or Kant’s.” And he concludes that “In cultures like India’s, the context-sensitive kind of rule is the preferred formulation.”</p>
      <p>There may be some truth to Ramanujan’s observations although it cannot be said that Indian philosophers cannot or do not generalize. One only has to look at the formulae of the Upanishads, ‘ tat tvam asi ’ and ‘ so hum ’ to realize that the Indians generalized at the far deeper and unitary levels than those of western philosophers. In fact, there is none more unitary than the Indian when he says, ‘ sarvam khalvidam brahma ’ or ‘ etad vai tat .’ The difficulty with the Indian generalizations or consistency is that it goes beyond intellectualism and speculation to psychological and experiential formulations that are not conceivable to the average human mind. And if the generalization is so general that it is applicable everywhere and anywhere, it tends to get overlooked in the practical world unless one is practicing intensely the spiritual disciplines called yoga in India. And thus, it means nothing in vyavhara, and is not noticed.</p>
      <p>There are no external rules, moral or ethical dicta, no edicts or farmaans. And such a profound unitary rule gives paradoxically the utmost freedom and latitude to the individual. And thus, there is no abstract reality out there; it is all lived intensely, personally by the practicing seeker. Thus, all subsequent declarations that deal with more superficial matters become nuanced and seem applicable only to a particular situation or time-space or to a particular kind of person.</p>
      <p>The Indian paradigm belongs to another order of experience that underlies the Western approach to blanket universalisms without being universal. This is almost akin to the Einsteinian world being another order to the model of the Newtonian world. Or the paradigm of quantum mechanics that forms the substrate in the modern understanding to the Rutherfordian, atomic model in physics.</p>
      <p>Obviously, any such generalizations as mine about India itself would be flawed and self-contradictory since Indians defy generalizations at least on the surface. And if it is true, that the Indian culture even today is together because it springs from the artesian wells of Vedas and Vedanta, then this too is easy to understand.</p>
      <p>India confuses, confounds, and confronts with its myriad array, that are spiritual and materialistic, subtle, and gross, cultured, and gross. Even time and space, the universal frames of reference, are inconstant. Rules change by yugas and kula, jati and ritu. And ritu, as Louis Renou points out, in Sanskrit et Culture, is not just a season, but also a crucial moment in Vedic sacrifice (the word ritam meaning right and the dynamic aspect of Sat ). There is a constant flowing together in samsara (which is the literal meaning of the word) and the body too is not just physical, it has also subtle and causal aspects.</p>
      <p>Perhaps one may say here that any generalization about the Indian way of thinking itself would be, paradoxically, an error.  The Indians traditionally have thought a lot (and even argued a lot), the more qualified understanding of an Indian way of thinking at the highest level is that it is not only immensely refined but also one that comes after a long preparatory development in self-refinement. Unfortunately, this refinement was restricted to only a select few in the Vedic times perhaps due to the nature of the society. And any attempt to spread the word had to use simplifications with its national epics, music, arts, darsanas, mythology, education, social and political sciences, and economic theory. This is where it began getting confusing. For the epics such as Mahabharata included multiple and diverse viewpoints of powerful personages in unique situations. Epics such as the Ramayana had almost 300 various tellings, each with its own storyline and interpretations, and the only common theme among all of them was perhaps the central place of the protagonists, Rama and Sita, and the tectonic shift in human society and evolution with their incarnation.</p>
      <p>It does not faze me that in some of these Ramayanas, the narrative changes. What is most unnerving is that the Indian mind of today does not understand the event that Rama’s life was in the national consciousness, and how it transformed humanity at a crucial juncture of its development. Those who need to understand Rama have no clue; they either turn into zealots or fiery partisans, blind to who Rama truly is. And those who have no clue about Rama write tomes on him and his human limitations. Nor does it disappoint me that the original impetus of thought and its energies are now lost in the confusion of modern India. For such is still latent and subterranean in my opinion and can always resurface, if we were to understand what it truly is.</p>
      <p>Ramanujan concluded his essay with the projection that “One might see modernization in India as a movement from the context-sensitive to the context-free in all realms; an erosion of contexts, at least in principle.” He also criticized the generalizations of “a Hindu view of life by apologues like Radhakrishnan for the benefit of both the Western and modern Indian readers.”</p>
      <p>Personally, I would hope that if India moves to a context-free way of thinking, it would be through the discovery of its own innate genius and the tremendous discoveries of its ancient past, although, necessarily, the modern formulation would be different. And if the generalization of a Hindu view of life by Radhakrishnan is too facile and superficial, so is Ramanujan’s hope that India would lose its unique way of seeing the world by getting modernized in the Western mode.</p>
      <p>William James with his sub-universes and Alfred Schutz with his ‘finite provinces of reality and relevance’ as central concepts, the paradoxical theories in modern physics with its wave and particle theories of light, and economic theories, micro- or macro- after E.F. Schumacher’s Small Is Beautiful, according to Ramanujan, might be worthy of being re-read in the light of these context-sensitive and context-free modes. Yet, in the same breath, he argues against the inconsistencies of Indian thought or, shall we say, Indian thoughts.</p>
      <p>It is the same bias towards looking outward for one’s salvation. Ramanujan looks towards the modern West even for his theories about the Indian way of thinking. The colonial mindset continues to haunt even the best and brightest of Indian minds. This might be a clue to the Indian way of thinking.</p>
      <p>There is none at present, actually. What we need perhaps to do is to retrieve it. To be able to question anything and everything in the original Indian manner, to be able to reject everything and start afresh perennially, neti neti (not this, not this), to never be satisfied and be complacent, to experiment and explore boldly. For if there was ever an Indian way of thinking, it was this. Not proceeding from fear but with innocence and profound questioning. And not rejecting one’s own way of being even if it meant rejecting the more successful and superficially enticing thinking models of the est. To articulate clearly and simply. Calmly and directly.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there is no bigger question facing the nation today than what Hinduism truly is, if it is not a religion, and how must it grow or be replaced by something greater, stronger, truer. And how does defining Hinduism or thinking about it change Bharata, which designation literally means a people deeply involved in discovering the Light and its manifestations. This self-lit way, this thinking lit by the glow of the Self or Atman, is the Indian way of thinking. This is our genius. And it can be recovered and re-discovered into the modern life.</p>

      <p>Is there such a thing as India? And if there is, how do we define it? Is it a nation? Or a civilization? Is it a federation of nations? A geographic entity? A concept? A vision? Or is it only the borders left by the British when they partitioned it in 1947?</p>
      <p>These are the questions that arise when one attempts to consider India. For truth be told, India is a confusing history and darshana, a vision so vast and integral that one gets lost in its profusion and multitude of languages, ethnicities, cultures, beliefs, religions, philosophies, and perhaps, even the definition of itself.</p>
      <p>Thus, to me, India is a meditation that I have attempted for as long as I remember, as long as I could think, and feel, as long as I could articulate myself and my confused understanding of its nature and definition. The present essay is an exploration and a journey. With a lot of collated facts but in the end only a deep sense of what it might be. Nor are these thoughts claimed by me to be absolute for all or even the correct ones. But perhaps if might begin to understand her vast expanse and reach, one might begin to understand oneself better. And perhaps humanity as a whole.</p>
      <p>I do not pretend to know the answers for when I behold her, I am awe-inspired and mystified, speechless, and grateful. For what she has given me and what I am today.</p>
      <p>And any history of Indian nationalism must first define what India is. Or at least, how she has been defined by others in the past and how we may approach her.</p>
      <p>For nationalism too must involve a nation. But India seems to elude one’s grasp. It seems to me far more than a nation. And perhaps we can settle that it is an ancient civilization. And it has stretched in mythology, itihasa and cultural memory, perhaps from Afghanistan in the Northwest as far down to Indonesia in the South East, as far north as Kashmir and as far south as Sri Lanka. And I say this without desiring to offend the great nations that seem to be included in its sabhyata.</p>
      <p>Perhaps then, there are many ways to define India. First, as a darshana and vision. Then, perhaps, as a culture and civilization. Then perhaps, a spirit that underlies all its chaotic and innumerable names and forms. And finally, perhaps, as a geographic entity that holds together a people who are together despite being split by artificial lines. And these definitions overlap, intermingle, interfuse, until a sense appears of what Sri Aurobindo called a Shakti, a living force, that may yet surprise us with a renaissance that is in the works at present.</p>
      <p>For if we define her as a civilization, we have to go back a few millennia and attempt to discover her roots and core, her Idea and her soul.  </p>
      <p>And this, I confess, is a labor of a lifetime. At least for me. I can only say one thing for sure. I cannot define her at all if I try to limit her to a geographic boundary or a particular religion or culture. Her beauty and grandeur, her detailed refinement and celebration of life always seem to slip through my fingers. And I can only behold her with utmost wonder and humility.</p>
      <p>India has had multiple names in its illustrious history. Some of these are Bharatvarsha, Aryavarta, Nabhivarta, Saptasindhu, Hindustan, and India. Each has its own etymology and development. And we will attempt to try to understand them one by one, with an exploration of their roots.</p>
      <i><h4>Bharat Varsha or the Land of the Bharatas</h4></i>
      <p>According to <i>Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India’s </i>Geography by Sanjeev Sanyal, Bharata Varsha is the ‘Land of the Bharatas’ mentioned in the Rig Veda. Later texts such as the Puranas would define it as ‘The country that lies north of the seas and south of the snowy mountain is called Bharatam, there dwell the descendants of Bharata’.”</p>
      <p class="hindi-text">“ उत्तरं यत्समुद्रस्य :  हिमाद्रेश्चैव दक्षिणम्  ।       
      वर्षं तद्   भारतं नाम :  भारती यत्र संततिः   ।।  </p>
      <p>Varsha signifies the year in Sanskrit. It might also signify Varsha or rains and a piece of land.  </p>
      <p>In The Incredible History of India’s Geography, Sanjeev Sanyal comes to a remarkable hypothesis: “That the Rig Vedic people and the Harappans were the same…. It is possible that the Harappans were a multi-ethnic society, just like India today. The Rig Vedic people may have been part of the bubbling mix.” If this is true, many of the questions about India’s ancient peoples might be answered.  </p>
      <p>The common misperception is that the Aryans invaded the Harappan civilization and destroyed it. However, there is no basis for this theory. Not only is there no evidence for the same, it seems that some Harappan customs have continued in Indian culture to this date according to Sanjeev Sanyal in Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India’s Geography, e.g., “namaste—the common Indian way to show respect to both people and the gods. There are several clay figurines from Harappan sites that show a person with palms held together in a namaste. There are even terracotta dolls of women with red vermillion on their foreheads. Is this the origin of the ‘sindur’ used by married Hindu women?”</p>
      <p>Michel Danino in The Lost River: On the Trail of the Sarasvati, has found more such continuities including “the persistence of the ratio 5:4” in architecture, town planning and Vedic yajnas. Also, “chess pieces that look remarkably like modern equivalents have been found at Harappan sites. It has long been known that chess originated in India but it is extraordinary that the game, or something similar, was being played more than four thousand years ago,” according to Sanjeev Sanyal. And he adds, “…the Harappans did not just disappear; they live on amongst us.”  </p>
      <p>It seems that the Harappans are the same as the Vedic people and their culture and genes lived on in India. There is simply no reason why one land should have been simultaneously inhabited by two cultures and one of them disappeared while the other continued as present-day India. Romila Thapar believes that the Harappan ‘material culture shows no continuities’ in The Penguin History of Early India. However, B.B. Lal with extensive research has shown in The Saraswati Flows On: The Continuity of Indian Culture  that “many of the present-day cultural traits are rooted in the Harappan Civilization.” Why is this important? It is to realize that India is an ancient land that has shared a sustained and shared culture with continuing threads of commonalities across a span of more than at least 6000 years. This makes more sense than an arbitrary hypothesis of the Aryan Invasion of the peninsula posited by early British Indologists.  </p>
      <p>Sanjeev Sanyal goes on to say, “The Harappan civilization and the Rig Veda coincide on many things—their time frames, their geography, the Bronze Age technology and even on the existence of the Saraswati river. Combined with the genetic data…it would seem that we are dealing with a population and culture that has continuously inhabited the subcontinent for a very long time. For some, especially archaeologists like B.B. Lal, the matter is settled.” </p>
      <i><h4>Sapta Sindhu or Seven Rivers </h4></i>
      <p>Sapta Sindhu or the seven sacred rivers are often referred to in the Rig Veda. Of these, Saraswati was considered the most important. The Avesta mentions the hapta hendu  which is generally equated with the Vedic Sapta Sindhavaha.</p>
      <p>Where did Saraswati disappear? Sanjeev Sanyal in the Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India’s Geography  believes that it is the river also known as the Ghagghar that dried up subsequently leading to the end of the populous cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro.  </p>
      <p>He notes that “The Vedas clearly mention a wider landscape watered by thrice-seven rivers….it is obvious that the Sapta-Sindhu is a sub-set of the wider Vedic landscape…. </p>
      <p>Coming together, glorious, loudly roaring— <br /> 
      Saraswati, Mother of Floods, the seventh—  <br />
      With copious milk, with fair streams strongly flowing,<br />  
      Fully swelled by the volume of their waters</p>
      <p>Some think nowadays that the Saraswati was a mythological river. And indeed, she is a name given to a form of the Mahashakti, the one who is sweet, detailed, the aradhya of the craftsman, the student, the artist, who works with the patience of centuries on the minutest and most granular perfection and leaves nothing incomplete or unfinished. “As a physical river, in the oldest texts of the Rig Veda it is described as a “great and holy river in north-western India,” but in the middle and late Rig Vedic books it is described as a small river ending in “a terminal lake (samudra)… (it) is a deified river first mentioned in the Rig Veda and later in Vedic and post-Vedic texts. It played an important role in the Vedic religion, appearing in all but the fourth book of the Rigveda….The Nadistuti hymn in the Rigveda (10.75) mentions the Sarasvati between the Yamuna in the east and the Sutlej in the west, while RV 7.95.1-2, describes the Sarasvati as flowing to the samudra, a word now usually translated as ‘ocean’,  but which could also mean “lake.” Later Vedic texts such as the Tandya Brahmana and the Jaiminiya Brahmana, as well as the Mahabharata, mention that the Sarasvati dried up in a desert.”</p>
      <p>Sri Aurobindo has proposed, on the other hand, that “the symbolism of the Veda betrays itself to the greatest clearness in the figure of the goddess Sarasvati … She is, plainly and clearly, the goddess of the World, the goddess of a divine inspiration …”</p>
      <p>“Diana Eck (in India: A Sacred Geography) notes that the power and significance of the Sarasvati for present-day India is in the persistent symbolic presence at the confluence of rivers all over India. Although “materially missing”, she is the third river, which emerges to join in the meeting of rivers, thereby making the waters thrice holy.”</p>
      <p>“The Vedic description of the goddess Sarasvati as a mighty river, and the Vedic and Puranic statements about the drying-up and diving-under of the Sarasvati, have been used by some as a reference point for a revised dating of the Vedic culture. Some see these descriptions as a mighty river as evidence for an earlier dating of the Rig Veda, identifying the Vedic culture with the Harappan culture, which flourished at the time that the Gaggar-Hakra hadn’t dried up, and rejecting the Indo-Aryan migrations theory, which postulates a migration at 1500 BCE. Michel Danino places the composition of the Vedas therefore in the third millennium BCE, a millennium earlier than the conventional dates.” </p>
      <p>Whether or not, the Ghagghar was Saraswati, it seems plausible that the Vedas could be more than 5000-6000 years old. For they were initially passed down from one generation to another orally; only about two millennia ago were they transcribed. It is also clear that the Indian civilization was heavily influenced by its rivers, especially the Saraswati, a river that according to several ancient texts subsequently dried. It is entirely possible that this drying caused a dissipation of the Harappans and caused its people to migrate to other areas of the nation spreading their culture, darshana and literature.</p>
      <p>The word Hindustan means the place of the Hindus. And it seems that it is derived from two Sanskrit words, Sindhu and Sthaan. The Greeks, unable to pronounce the S sound, called it Hindu and the place of Hindus became popularly known as Hindustan.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Brahmavarta, the Holy land, according to Sanjeev Sanyal, is the land ‘lying between the Saraswati and the Drishtadvati,’ an area that could be present-day Haryana and north Rajasthan. And he states that “In my view, the importance of the Land of the Seven Rivers probably derives from it being the home of the Bharatas, a tribe that would give Indians the name by which they call themselves.” </p>
      <p>Aryavarta in the ancient tongue meant the land of the Aryas. Aryas comes from the Sanskrit root Ari, which means to plough, to farm, in agriculture, but also someone who is a person of self-refinement. ‘It refers to a cultured or noble person—which means that all (Rig Vedic) groups like to refer to themselves as Aryan…The use of the word in a racial sense occurs in ancient Iran and modern Europe but not in India.” Sri Aurobindo has debunked the theory of the Aryan Invasion of the Dravidian people in his two remarkable translations and commentaries on the Vedas, The Secret of the Vedas and Hymns to the Mystic Fire. </p>

      <div class="blog-content">
      <p>A dharma yuddha, unlike other battles fought on the ground, is mostly invisible and inaudible, it is waged in the depths of consciousness and engages ancient unseen forces that have always been on earth to resist the victory of Light and Truth.</p>
      <p>Dharma is not religion but the creative force of Truth, and it has always struggled to maintain its foothold on earth, for human nature, still largely unregenerate and driven by forces of ignorance and egoism, opposes Truth in all possible ways.</p>
      <p>The earth, as our ancients explained, is the field of evolution and therefore critical for both, the forces of Truth and those of Darkness and Ignorance. It is on earth alone that the consciousness can grow to its true heights and fathom its true depths; and for this, the noblest souls choose to be born on earth so that they can participate in the evolution. There are other planes of consciousness too besides earth, but those are all typal planes where the being neither evolves nor devolves. It is on earth alone that one can evolve to a perfect godlike consciousness, daivic, or devolve to a demonic one, asuric. Therefore the forces of Truth and Falsehood have been engaged in a timeless battle for supremacy on earth — for whichever force dominates earth will dominate evolution. If Falsehood were ever to dominate earth (no, in spite of all contrary appearances, it still does not), this universe would be one of falsehood where the Asuras would grow in stature and become the godheads of this Cosmos. Instead of a Rama or Krishna, we would have a Ravana or Kamsa presiding over the evolution of consciousness on earth.</p>
      <p>This timeless great battle, the Mahayuddha, took a major and decisive turn in 1956 when the Supermind (Truth Consciousness, Vijnanamaya Shakti ) descended into the earth atmosphere after ages of intense tapasya and spiritual struggle against the forces of evolution. The descent of the Truth Consciousness itself changed the course of the spiritual history of humanity decisively, irreversibly. But that did not mean that the victory of Truth was assured. On the contrary, the asuric forces intensified their energies and multiplied their efforts to push back the Truth, perhaps destroy it altogether.</p>
      <p>However, Truth being what it is, it cannot be destroyed, but it can be pushed back, opposed and resisted, driven underground. And that is what is happening today, all around us, from global religious and political platforms to our homes and hearts, wherever even a trace of falsehood exists, there the battle rages, unseen and unsounded.</p>
      <p>Make no mistake about this: each one of us is an instrument, a nimitta, in this great battle for earth. Which way the battle will go depends on how much of ourselves, our consciousnesses and will, we put into this battle, how much of our skin is in the game, how conscious and silent we can remain even as the battle rages furiously on.</p>
      <p>But to fight, to be in the thick of this battle, to be effective and efficient instruments of the Truth in this pitched battle against cosmic, terrestrial and psychological falsehoods, there is a necessary preparation that all have to undergo, a secret Kshatriya training of old, a training as much spiritual as physical and psychological.</p>
      <ol style="list-style: numeric; padding-left: 15px;">
      <li class="font-ibm">The true warrior of Light must be immersed in the Light first. None should allow even a shadow to be cast on one’s mind or heart. One has to have complete and unrelenting fidelity to Truth, to Light, to what our ancients called jyoti parasya. This is nothing short of tapasya but it needs to be enormously concentrated and hastened. We do not have the time for years of sadhana. These are times for intensification, concentrated acceleration.</li>
      <li class="font-ibm">For this intensification and acceleration, two conditions are necessary: deep inner silence and absolute samata. Samata is equality of spirit, equality of mind and heart: there must not be the least inner disturbance, agitation or excitement. The warrior of Light must always wear a luminous armor. As Sri Krishna says to Arjuna: agitation obscures the Light. Remember, this is what the asuras around us want, to obscure our Light through contaminating our own inner state, by throwing into us their disturbances and excitements, their bitternesses and grievances, their soul-sapping selfishnesses and fears. Remember too that there is no way an asuric being can directly attack an armor of Light — they can only attack by using our consent and our will, which sometimes we too innocently and willingly give.</li>
      <li class="font-ibm">Samata is a shield in this battle. None can pierce the shield of perfect samata. No matter how disturbing or hostile the circumstances, our equality of spirit must be firm, unshakeable, absolute. It is this shield that the Divine Master in us needs to wage this battle. Without this shield, even the Lord cannot fight. This shield of perfect samata is not too difficult if we understand the two elements needed to create it: an absolute faith in the Master, in Sri Krishna; and a vast surrender to Him. Nothing else is needed. With faith and a perfect surrender, the warrior can go through any battle unscathed.</li>
      <li class="font-ibm">Inner silence is the psychological condition for the battle. No thought must arise, no desire to destroy, no fear of being destroyed. The mind and heart must remain immutably calm, the being quiet and concentrated. With such an inner condition of silence, of unbreakable mauna, the warrior becomes one with the Force of Narayan working through him or her.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is our unseen battle, and this is the inner preparation needed. There is no time to waste. The stakes are high. But we have, on our side, the Shakti of the Truth Consciousness itself.</p>

      <img src="https://bluone-ink.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images/blogs/madhusudans-bowl.jpg" alt="Madhusudan’s Bowl" />
      <p>In a remote village in Bengal, in a small hut by the village pond, lived a simple widowed woman with her eight year old child, Gopi. She was poor and barely managed to earn a livelihood enough to feed and clothe her child and herself. Yet she was very keen that her child should go to school and learn. That was one thing that was very important. So she made sure that Gopi went to school everyday. But the school was far and one had to pass through a deep and dark forest on the way. She, therefore, accompanied Gopi to school for the first few days but then it became difficult for her to do as she had her own work to do.</p>
      <p>So she told her child that he would have to go to school alone. Naturally, the boy was not very happy. The woods were so dark…</p>
      <p>“Don’t you worry, son,” the mother said, “your elder brother lives in the forest and he will come to you whenever you lose your way or feel frightened.”</p>
      <p>“My elder brother?” Gopi repeated slowly. “How shall I call him or know him?”</p>
      <p>A certain image and a name flashed past the mother’s mind, something out of her own long-forgotten childhood.“His name is Madhusudan,” she said. “Just call for him!”</p>
      <p>So Gopi left the next day for school alone. He walked through the forest strangely reassured that his elder brother was always somewhere nearby. But then he was so young, and soon his courage gave way to doubt and trepidation. Would he be able to make it all the way? The forest was so thick. And he could hear strange sounds. Suddenly he heard a movement in the distance and froze. What was that? Now he was frightened. So, shutting tight his eyes, he called out — “Madhusudan! Madhusudan!”</p>
      <p>And, lo and behold, Gopi felt a soft touch on his shoulder. Startled, he opened his eyes. Standing right before him was a boy only slightly older than him, but strong and bright. He had a kind and friendly face, and the young boy felt reassured immediately.</p>
      <p>“You live here, Madhu dada?” The boy asked innocently.</p>
      <p>The older boy nodded, smiling. “And you are afraid of the forest?” He asked, teasingly.</p>
      <p>Gopi felt embarrassed. How could he be afraid of the forest?</p>
      <p>“Don’t worry,” the older boy said, still smiling. “We are all afraid. It is a very thick forest.”</p>
      <p>“Are you afraid too, dada?”</p>
      <p>“Sometimes,” the older boy replied. “But I don’t let the fear stop me. Come, I’ll walk you to your school.”</p>
      <p>And so they started walking together.</p>
      <p>“Do you really live in the forest, Madhu dada?” Asked Gopi, wondering how anyone could live alone in such a forest.</p>
      <p>“I live in your heart, my brother. That is why I am there whenever and wherever you call me!”</p>
      <p>“Wow! That’s magical, isn’t it?” Gopi exclaimed, his heart and voice full of wonder. “So we can always meet and talk and play whenever I call you?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, of course!” Madhusudan replied. “It all depends on your call!”</p>
      <p>And thus, speaking of many things, they reached the school. As soon as Gopi could see the school building, Madhusudan disappeared. Gopi, getting a little used to his elder brother’s magical powers, walked alone up to the school, very happy because he had found a brother and a friend almost his age.</p>
      <p>After that, Gopi couldn’t wait to go to school just because he wanted to be with Madhu dada and walk with him through the forest. Day after day, as he walked through the forest with Madhusudan, he learned so many new things, about trees, animals, birds, wild fruits and flowers. Madhusudan had an answer for every question that the boy could ask. Sometimes they would even run up strange new paths, and explore parts of the forest Gopi would have never known. Every morning and afternoon became so delightful for him.</p>
      <p>Gopi, of course, completely outgrew his fear of the forest. He would call Madhu dada now not because he couldn’t walk alone through the forest but because he wanted Madhu dada’s company. He not only felt safe in Madhu dada’s company but strangely uplifted, as if he was the strongest boy in the world and he could do anything he wanted to. Madhu dada was so kind and loving, and so wise!</p>
      <p>One day, Gopi’s teacher, called Mastermashai by all his students, announced that he would be celebrating his birthday in two days and he wanted every child to bring him a gift. It was customary for the village children to bring gifts for the teacher on his birthday. When Gopi got home that evening, he sat beside his mother and and told her about his teacher’s birthday celebration. “I know we are poor, Ma,” Gopi said, “and we cannot afford a gift for Mastermashai. But everyone else will be bringing something or the other.”</p>
      <p>Gopi’s mother felt sad and wished she could send something with Gopi. But she felt helpless.</p>
      <p>“Should I ask Madhu dada?” Gopi asked suddenly, perking up as the thought struck him.</p>
      <p>Gopi’s mother looked at her son with surprise. She knew there was no Madhu dada in the forest. It was all Gopi’s imagination. But before she could say anything, Gopi ran off, excited. His mother sat quietly, watching the evening sky.</p>
      <p>The next morning, as he entered the forest, he saw Madhu dada waiting for him, a smile on his lips. “How is my little brother today?” Madhusudan asked playfully.</p>
      <p>Gopi quickly explained the situation. Madhusudan smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Gopi. I’ll give you a bowl of delicious sweet curd to carry for your teacher. I assure you that he will love it!”</p>
      <p>So saying, Madhusudan handed Gopi a bowl of curd that seemed to appear out of thin air. Gopi smiled to himself. He was enjoying dada’s magic tricks!</p>
      <p>“Isn’t the bowl a bit too small, dada?” Asked Gopi. “But it doesn’t matter,” he quickly added, “Mastermashai will be happy!”</p>
      <p>Everyone in the class was excited that morning. The teacher was receiving gifts from each child. And everyone had brought wonderful gifts. Mastermashai seemed so happy. Gopi felt somewhat ashamed, carrying such a small and inconspicuous bowl for Mastermashai. He kept the bowl out of sight. Mastermashai soon caught Gopi’s eye and smiled at him. “So what have you brought for me, Gopi?” He asked.</p>
      <p>Gopi held out the small bowl, hesitant and embarrassed. Mastermashai took the bowl and looked at it for a few seconds. “Ah, looks like sweet curd! But what a small bowl! How will I feed my guests with this?” There was a note of derision in Mastermashai’s voice. Gopi wished he could melt away.</p>
      <p>Mastermashai kept the bowl beside him on the table, amongst all the other delicacies and gifts.</p>
      <p>Later in the afternoon, after everyone had left, the teacher’s servant started cleaning up the room. He noticed the bowl sitting on the table and drew the teacher’s attention to it. The teacher looked at the bowl and chuckled. “That poor boy,” he muttered to himself. “Give it to me, let me finish the curd.”</p>
      <p>And so saying, he took the bowl and finished off the curd in a single gulp. And he stood transfixed for a moment. What a wonderful taste! He quickly licked off the last remnant of the curd and put the bowl aside.</p>
      <p>As soon as he did that, the bowl filled up again. The teacher stared at the bowl in disbelief. He gingerly picked up the bowl again and tasted the curd in it. It was as delicious as before. He greedily finished off the curd in the bowl and kept it aside again. And again, the bowl filled up. The teacher couldn’t believe what he was seeing. He asked his servant to empty the bowl into a bigger one. The servant immediately did what he was told. But the bowl filled up again. The servant came back running to his master, excited and frightened.</p>
      <p>“It is some kind of magic, Sir,” he said excitedly, “the bowl keeps filling up each time I empty it! I have filled up all the utensils in the kitchen, Sir!”</p>
      <p>“This is amazing!” The teacher said, barely able to control his own excitement. “I must find out from Gopi where he got this from.”</p>
      <p>The next morning when Gopi came to school, the teacher was waiting for him at the gate. “Where did you get the bowl of curd, Gopi? Who gave it to you?” He asked immediately.</p>
      <p>“Madhu dada gave it to me, Mastermashai.” Gopi replied, a bit apprehensive.</p>
      <p>“Where does your Madhu dada live?” Asked Mastermashai.</p>
      <p>“In my heart, Mastermashai. But he meets me in the forest.”</p>
      <p>Mastermashai looked at Gopi quizzically. “Meets you in the forest?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, Mastermashai — he always walks me down to school and back home.”</p>
      <p>“He must be a magician,” Mastermashai said, “can I meet him too?”</p>
      <p>And so Gopi and his teacher went back to the edge of the forest where Gopi called out to Madhu dada. In a moment, Madhusudan appeared beside Gopi.</p>
      <p>“Yes, Gopi?” Madhusudan said gently.</p>
      <p>The teacher couldn’t see or hear Madhusudan. “Where is your Madhu dada, Gopi?” The teacher asked, a trifle impatient.</p>
      <p>“Why, here he is!” Gopi pointed out to Madhusudan.</p>
      <p>“But I can’t see him!” Mastermashai repeated.</p>
      <p>“But here he is, Mastermashai,” Gopi again pointed to Madhusudan, who was looking on slightly with an amused smile.</p>
      <p>“Your teacher cannot see or hear me, Gopi,” Madhusudan said gently, “because his heart is not as pure as yours, and his heart does not have love for me.”</p>
      <p>Gopi repeated Madhusudan’s words to his teacher. The teacher understood at once what was happening. He knew in his heart whose presence he was standing in. Tears filled his eyes and deep remorse filled his heart. He handed the magic bowl back to Gopi and walked back slowly towards the school.</p>
      <p>Gopi looked at Madhusudan. Madhusudan smiled back at him and disappeared.</p>
      <p>And so the story goes that Gopi and his mother never had to go without food again. Whatever was needed, Madhusudan’s bowl would provide in abundance. Did Gopi understand who his elder brother, Madhusudan, was? We will never know because Gopi never spoke of Madhu dada to anyone again.</p>
      <p>[ Translator’s note: Dada is used as a term of respect for an elder brother in Bengali; hadi means bowl or pot; School teachers in Bengal are often addressed as Mastermashai and the word means ‘revered Master’; Madhusudan is one of the names used for Sri Krishna. ]</p>

      <p>The story of Devdas and the mysterious sadhu…What did the sadhu give, and what did Devdas find?</p>
      <p>Devdas was an ordinary man living an ordinary life in the city of Benares. He used to work as an accountant for a wealthy merchant. One day, while walking back from work, he decided to go the river bank and cool off for a while before heading home.</p>
      <p>He was sitting on the ghat watching the river when he saw an old hermit, a sadhu, standing before him. The Sadhu was in ochre robe, his hair matted, his face aglow with beauty and power. As if prompted from within, Devdas stood up and bowed to the Sadhu.</p>
      <p>The Sadhu spoke to Devdas as if he had always known him intimately: “Quit your job and meet me here, by the Ganga, three days from now.” Then, as if by magic, he disappeared.</p>
      <p>Devdas went next day to the merchant and, a bit nervously, announced his decision to quit. The merchant liked Devdas and tried to persuade him to change his mind. But Devdas persisted and so the merchant reluctantly let him go. Devdas did not have many friends or acquaintances in town, so he was not missed.</p>
      <p>Three days later, Devdas met the Sadhu on the bank of the Ganga.</p>
      <p>The Sadhu said to him, “Go throw yourself into the Ganga! Maybe you will be saved by someone,” and, just as before, disappeared.</p>
      <p>Devdas thought only for a moment: “It is a strange command, indeed!” He then jumped into the Ganga. Devdas was a good swimmer, so he did not drown. He kept drifting farther away from the city of Benares, as the day faded into dusk.</p>
      <p>Late into the night, fatigued, just managing to float, he bumped into a fisherman’s boat. The fisherman pulled him up into the boat and scolded him: “You foolish man! The current is strong and will sweep you away. What do you think you are doing?”</p>
      <p>Devdas shrugged his shoulder and said, “I don’t know!” He then curled up on the floor of the boat and went to sleep.</p>
      <p>The fishermen took pity on this mad man and took him home. When he discovered that Devdas was educated and could write and speak well, he asked him to stay back and help him. Devdas, thus, became the fisherman’s apprentice and tried his best to be of use to him.</p>
      <p>A few month’s passed. Then, one fine morning, the Sadhu appeared to Devdas again and said: “Leave this place now. No need to bid goodbye. Your fisherman friend will be looked after.”</p>
      <p>Devdas immediately left the fisherman’s hut and started walking in the direction of the next town. He kept walking for the rest of the day till he came upon a small village. It was getting dark. He lay himself down to rest. He was so tired that he drifted off into sleep. He awoke as the sun came up. And he saw a farmer approaching him on a buffalo.</p>
      <p>“Are you looking for work?”, the farmer asked Devdas, “I am looking for help — the harvesting season starts in a day or two.”</p>
      <p>Devdas agreed to help him through the season. The farmer, impressed by Devdas’ skills and hard work, asked him to stay back longer and Devdas again agreed. He was neither happy nor unhappy: no question or doubt arose in his mind.</p>
      <p>More than two years passed by. Devdas made some money of his own and saved most of it as he had no expenses. He also learnt much about farming and markets.</p>
      <p>Then one day, as the winters approached, the Sadhu returned to him and told him, “Now leave this farming and go to Pataliputra. Use the money you have save to set up your own shop. Do something useful!” The Sadhu, as always, disappeared as mysteriously as before.</p>
      <p>As always, Devdas obeyed without a moment’s hesitation. He left the farm and the farmer and started walking again. He walked for many days and, at last, reached Pataliputra. He took some weeks to settle into the new city and set up his own shop selling farm produce.</p>
      <p>He did well and prospered. He also became quite well known. People who would meet him would come back quite impressed. “There is something about this man,” most would say of Devdas, “one feels at peace around him!”</p>
      <p>Many years passed without the Sadhu reappearing to Devdas. Devdas continued to work hard and prosper. He was still quite a loner but now many folks wanted to come to him, buy from him and spend time with him. He even bagan to think of finally settling down, perhaps buy his own farm and build a house for himself.</p>
      <p>And then, one fine day, the Sadhu came back.</p>
      <p>Devdas bowed again to the Sadhu and waited, with no restlessness, no question, no expectation.</p>
      <p>“Give me your money,” said the Sadhu quietly, “and go to Nalanda. You will find an old ashram on the outskirts. Go and find some work there.”</p>
      <p>Davdas gave all his money to the Sadhu and left for Nalanda.</p>
      <p>When Devdas reached the ashram and the inmates met him, they all bowed in reverence and thought a great sage had come to their ashram. They welcomed Devdas and invited him to stay with them for however long he wanted.</p>
      <p>Devdas had changed much now. What the others saw in Devdas was an ethereal light, a mysterious glow upon his face and a profundity in his eyes. As the days passed, everyone in the ashram began to realize that they had a holy man in their midst. People from all around started visiting him. Word spread. Even scholars from the great university started coming to him.</p>
      <p>“Who is your teacher, Sir,” they would all ask, ”To what lineage do you belong?”</p>
      <p>And Devdas would say, “That is difficult to answer”.</p>
      <p>Devdas was always a man of few words, but now he had become even quieter. But there was always a twinkle in his eyes, as if he was enjoying some cosmic joke.</p>
      <p>His friends and disciples would ask, “How did it all start, Sir? Tell us your story..”</p>
      <p>And Devdas would say, “I was an accountant to a merchant in Benares. Then one day, I left.”</p>
      <p>“Did you take sannyas? Did you renounce the world?” They would all ask.</p>
      <p>“No,” Devdas would reply, “I just walked one day. And kept walking”</p>
      <p>They wouldn’t understand him but they would all feel awed by the mystery and power around him.</p>
      <p>The elders at the ashram once approached him to write the story of his life and sadhana, to inspire the young. This, they said, was the tradition.</p>
      <p>Devdas readily agreed and told his story: “I jumped into the Ganga and nearly drowned when a fisherman took me into his boat. I became a fisherman with him. Then, one day, I left his hut and went away to become a farmhand. Then I left farming and became a merchant. I earned some money. I then gave away all the money and came here. And here I am.”</p>
      <p>“But,”, the elders persisted, “this tells us nothing. No teacher or teaching, no tradition, no awakening…It’s quite inexplicable! How did all the wisdom and peace come to you?”</p>
      <p>And Devdas said, “That is how it was meant to be.”</p>
      <p>And, so the story goes, the elders created a deep mystical story around Devdas because saints and mystics must have their stories, with childhood miracles and predictions and great revelations thrown in. Thus was Devdas transformed into a living Saint.</p>
      <p>But somewhere in that ashram, even today, Devdas sits alone smoking a hukkah and waiting for a Sadhu.</p>
      <p>With a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

      <p>The story of Devdas and the mysterious sadhu…What did the sadhu give, and what did Devdas find?</p>
      <p>Is Swami Vivekananda important? To some, he is an apostle of Sanatana Dharma, a stalwart for the ‘Eternal Philosophy’ who led the Indian renaissance from centuries of hibernation. To others, mainly from the Left, he is a right-wing Hindu reactionary who attempted to disguise India’s backwardness and Brahminism with unscientific spirituality.</p>
      <p>It is possible that his celebrated address at the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago on September 11, 1893 did not have the effect that has been claimed by his apologists. For in those days, one did not go ‘viral’, nor had a marketing strategy for social media or Twitter handles with a huge following and likes. But it is definitely true that he had a greater impact on the Indian psyche and our self-confidence and belief in our own culture and darshana. His own letter about the event mentions that there were more than ‘five to seven thousand in the audience’. That seems to be a significant number. If we look at his tireless efforts in reaching out to the West, it does appear that he was able to create an awareness about the Indic civilization and values in Europe and the US. To me, it seems like the beginnings at the Gangotri, where drop by single drop, a glacier melts to gather eventually into the vast Ganges that nourishes almost 500 million people in its plains today.</p>
      <p>We were thirsting for any kind of relevance or recognition, relegated to the dust-heaps of history by the white sahibs. He stood up to them. Spoke in their own language with authority and conviction. Agreed that they had something great about their civilization but we had something greater. More importantly, he stood up for Sanatan Dharma, without compromising on its core principles. Fearlessly. Evoking our own truths and greatness.</p>
      <p>If one looks at him objectively, he does not seem to be a reactionary. After all, he was hardest on our own laziness and superciliousness, our own institutions such as casteism, gender bias, ritualism and social structures and our own refusal to grow and learn. He broke our taboos and, we are told, even asked an aspiring youth to play football and eat meat so that he could be strong and manly. So that we would stand for ourselves by discovering who we are.</p>
      <p>Whenever I think of Swami Vivekananda, I see the image of a lion roaring in the jungle. But this was a lion who also worked hard and wrote, travelled, lectured, taught, mentored. He met tremendous resistance, more from our own pundits and fossilized leaders. And yet, he was tireless in his efforts to awaken us. This, to me, is his biggest contribution to India.</p>
      <p>When I was growing up, I did not study him much. I was more influenced by Sri Aurobindo, J Krishnamurthy and Maharishi Ramana. Even now, I find him hard to read and it is true that I am inspired more by his vision than his writings. He had a dream that was at once ancient and modern, eternal and radically new. He was a true Indian in outlook, world-view and thought, and yet, he was global and truly inclusive.</p>
      <p>In reading about him in a new book by Makarand R Paranjape, I realize how much we owe to him. There is so much we did not know about the Swami and are still learning. For example, his meeting with Nikola Tesla, the great scientist, and their discussions about prana and akasa which Tesla quoted years later marveling at the Indian understanding of the cosmos. Or Swamiji’s meeting with Jamsetji Tata and their initiative to establish an institute of science in India.</p>
      <p>Makarand has shared some new insights about India’s first spiritual-activist with well-researched documentation. We need more such scholarly works about our great leaders and teachers in this world of alt-news and fake feeds.</p>
      <p>Makarand, an educator, poet, essayist and litterateur, has explored the character of Swami Vivekananda with sympathy, objectivity and careful review of information about the foremost exponent of Hinduism. It is critical that we understand the true depths of Sanatan Dharma, free of fundamentalism, and yet not devoid of intensity and clarity, by studying Swamiji. For today, the very significance of our dharma and truth is being questioned and challenged once again.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that even though Swami Vivekananda is gone and not fully appreciated even now, his dream about a great and advanced India continues. We are part of the unfolding of that dream, whether we realize it or not. Perhaps in this manner, Swami Vivekananda has created what we are today.</p>
      <p>To aspire for purity and wideness and heights like him, to live a life burning with that vision, would be our greatest homage to our first modern Rishi. Who spoke in English, held discussions with Western women and men, smoked and travelled in liners and was thoroughly modern in outlook. And yet, so ancient at the same time, that he defied his age and time.</p>
      <p>It seems to me sometimes that we are still catching up to Swamiji’s grand vision. As only subliminal characters in a dream who have yet to wake up. To discover the trail he blazed literally, in a short life and a shorter public career.</p>

      <p>Who is Shiva? Is he a puranic god, member of the trinity, who destroys even as Brahma creates and Vishnu preserves? Or is he the first yogi, who sat on top of Kailasa, smeared with ash, snakes round his neck, hair matted, lost in the reveries of dhatura and bhaang? Or is he the lingam seen in ubiquitous temples in India with a yoni reflective of some pagan symbolism?</p>
      <p>To my understanding, Shiva is our highest possibility. Hinduism has always maintained that not only is it possible to experience and live the Divine, Divinity is our inherent nature. That Shiva is pure consciousness, without any attributes, other than absolute stillness upholding intensest activity, the ineffable, the formless and the all-pervasive.</p>
      <p>In one definition, Shiva means nothing. This is a beautiful understanding. For the God who has no attributes, who is beyond thoughts and concepts, is everything because nothing. Similar to the Shoonya of the Buddha, Shiva is thus timeless, spaceless and causeless and is the origin and summit of the Universe. Hinduism teaches us that he is also the origin and summit of each of us, individually, and that it behooves us to discover our highest potential and be it, manifest it and become its living expression.</p>
      <p>Hinduism also explains that there are various levels of manifestation, starting from the grossest to the subtlest to the causal. And Shiva is represented in various ways by various adorers. But, eventually, Shiva is an experience and a reality, a revelation and the Truth of existence.</p>
      <p>How shall we reach him? He has taught us countless ways, including Sankhya and Vedanta, Buddhism and yoga, bhakti and advaita. But, above all, to understand that he is beyond any quality we try to describe him with is an auspicious beginning. And Shiva also means an auspicious start.</p>
      <p>The two beeja sounds of Shiva are Shi and Va according to the Shiv Rahasya. Shi means stillness and that in whom all things rest. Va implies movement and creation. He is the nothing from whom the Universe springs.</p>
      <p>He is the utmost and the untainted in us. He is hidden, though clearly visible to the loving eye. He is that without whom this cosmos may exist not even for a moment. The stillness of the mind in dhyana. The quiet love in our hearts without desire. The greatest teachers such as the Buddha, Sankaracharya and Vivekanada are his emanations. All we need to do is peel the blinds of our eyes and he is everywhere and everything.</p>
      <p>Hinduism exalts the formless and the transcendent. But it does not reject form and the immanent. For what is form if not a manifestation of the formless? What is that which is clear and vast as the sky but is also not the minutest and smallest grain? It is he who I am. And just this realization is enough to tear off all the veils of ignorance from the eyes of the seeker.</p>
      <p>One of the highest realizations of Vedanta is Shivoham, that Shiva am I. It is only appropriate that he who is nothing, is also the dance of the cosmos as Nataraja, and the fourth state of awareness beyond waking, sleep and dream, known as turiya. And his oneness with Shakti gives us one of the profoundest symbols of male and female complementarity in the ardha-nareeshvara.</p>
      <p>And it is fitting too that Sankaracharya’s famous Nirvana Shatkam ends with this stanza, “Aham nirvikalpo nirakar roopo … Chidananda roopah Shivoham Shivoham.” Free of duality, form of the formless … The form of consciousness and bliss, that Shiva am I, that Shiva am I.</p>

      <p>Continuing our explorations into the yogic secrets of the body with Alok Pandey</p>
      <p>We are so used to seeing the body so much as organs, tissues, cells and their functions that we fail to observe any consciousness inherent in it. Is the body something unconscious, a machine driven by mechanical energy? It may appear so at first, but a deeper probe reveals that a consciousness stands behind the seemingly unconscious machine. The first impression itself is of a battalion of cells that has repeatedly rehearsed their drill and execute it to the minutest perfection. Or of an orchestra playing a concert with various musical instruments. What we see is the final performance, but what we do not see are the years of patient practice. This programming of each cell (in our body’s case) to perform a certain drill or strike a certain note in the concert of the body’s movements has come through aeons of conditioning. The fixity of laws and processes are the result of an adaptive conditioning over the years. Whether this conditioning and memory is passed down through the genetic mechanism or in some other way is open to discussion. But the fact of adaptation in one body acquired through years being transmitted to others of the species in a rapid and spontaneous way is an undisputed thing.</p>
      <p>Whatever be the mechanism behind this evolutionary adaptation this conditioning has its advantages. It provides stability essential for useful and coordinated function. It also provides a rapidity of response to known environmental cues and so enhances survival. But the flip side of this is a fixity, which prevents us from discovering new ways of understanding and meeting the challenges of life. The horns and the tail so useful to animal life become meaningless at the human level with the full development of hands and its power to hold and grasp. Again, for example, even when we eliminate fear of an object or social situation from our mind, the body still gives the response of fear in the form of a tremor. But once this fear is deconditioned from the physical body, it is done for good. The body is difficult to decondition but once done, the lesson is permanent. The memory of the mind may fail but the body’s imprints remain.</p>
      <h4>The Physical Consciousness</h4>
      <p>So where is the seat of physical imprint and memory? Where is the blueprint which registers all the changes and transmits it down the line and even horizontally? One can still stretch one’s imagination to conceive of reverse t-RNA, a strand of RNA that carries information from the cell surface to the nuclei. Its importance is that it is perhaps the micro-chip linking the outside world with the inside of a cell. Thus our environment (physical and psycho-spiritual) can induce changes within the cell itself, carrying messages from the outside to the nucleus and effectuating genetic changes to be subsequently passed down the generations. What is not so easily conceivable is the transmission of the evolutionary changes horizontally as if our very physical being extended into one another as a single continuum! The only way to understand this is that behind the gross and visible physical body is a layer of subtle physical consciousness extending as the archetype holding the imprints and images of our past as well as the present and the future. It is this physical consciousness that mingles with the gross physical body and becomes one with it. In fact the gross body is nothing but a derivative product precipitated through the condensation of this physical consciousness.</p>
      <p>The physical consciousness is like the healthy background against which the changing patterns of our physical being are matched and certified as healthy or sick. A consequent directive follows to correct the imbalance and the entire body’s processes adjust to its dictates. Or else we may visualize the physical consciousness as the uncorrupted original file containing the plans and processes of the gross body. Genes, chemical reactions, the various functions are only intermediary processes that adjust of themselves in accordance with the central directive. The real map and contours, the inner geography and history of each form is there in the individual physical consciousness. Perhaps, considering the great importance of this subtle body, Nature has kept this original file in secrecy lest our all too human curiosity corrupts it. Yet Nature does lend all its secrets if we pursue it rightly. So too the physical consciousness can be studied, awakened and called upon to assist in the healing as well as the evolutionary process. It is the last frontier where the sense of a separate body is preserved without losing the innate sense of oneness behind all physical existence and within the different parts of the body itself.  Just as computer programming is not on the display screen or circuits, but in the mind of the programmer, the fixity of patterns in body movements and functions is not in the gross structure or genetic code (which are mainly transcripts), but in the physical consciousness that receives and transmits influences from subtle levels of consciousness.</p>
      <p>If subtlety and an incessant urge to progress are the hallmarks of mind and fluidity and an ever expanding plasticity are the hallmarks of life, then it may well be said that fixity and inertia are the hallmarks of the physical consciousness and the body. It is only natural that this be so because the very purpose of the body is to provide a stable basis for our individual existence. The human body is much like the take-off field for various types of aircrafts in the form of thoughts, feelings, desires, impulses, etc. If the field is not good then the forces of life and mind suffer a diminution and labour under great duress. The solidity of the field may not guarantee an equally robust and healthy life and mind but it does open such a possibility. In contrast, a handicap at the physical level generally (exceptions apart) does limit the possibilities. To take a common experience, while it is possible for us to turn our thoughts and emotions upwards or downwards when we are in a state of physical health, our thinking and feeling get grossly constricted when we are sick, say with fever! The significance of the body can therefore never be underestimated. The hardware has to be commensurate with the software we wish to install.</p>
      <h4>The Hardware of the Body and its Future Possibilities</h4>
      <p>Much of the body’s evolutionary hardware still pertains to our animal past and life in the jungles. If developed we can still recover many of the lost capabilities of animal life. A methodical programme of physical exercises can turn our muscles into steel, our legs into powerful wheels and our heart into an extraordinary pumping machine. But that would not really be a forward march but a sliding back to a left behind past. The physical consciousness has however not only the imprints of the past but also and more importantly the blueprints of the future. Any evolutionary change must first transit itself through the subtle physical consciousness and then trickle to the gross body through a complex system of nerves. The subtle body has many other possibilities than merely those of our animal past. It can, for example, escape the laws of gravity, change its size according to need, create additional covering for itself as a cloth wrapped around us, extend a portion of itself into other things, prolong its existence, reconstitute itself into different shapes, reach out through the subtle senses far beyond our limited sense, draw energy directly without food, transmute the experience of pain into delight, multiply itself and possibly exist indefinitely. We find these exceptional and higher possibilities manifested in the case of rare yogis. These rare possibilities, often mocked by our arrogant and limited science as fantasy and myths, are yet the things that would manifest in the future. The hidden possibility must one day come out and the concealed and latent energies release themselves. The human body may have an animal past; it yet has a god’s future.</p>
      <p>It is in this evolutionary direction that we need to develop the hardware of the body. This would need a twofold effort. First, an awakening and development of the body to its own highest human possibilities, that is, to bring the now automatic functions under a wilful, conscious and voluntary control. Next, to further sublimate the possibilities by the pressure of higher and higher energies accessible to us. The body consciousness has first to be awakened out of its animal sleep and next opened to the spiritual influences from above. It would need again a twofold labour. A deconditioning of the body from many of the animal instincts, which hinder the full play of higher energies in us, is the first requirement. The next requirement is to link our thus purified physical consciousness with the spiritual existence above through an aspiration and surrender.</p>
      <p>In fact, all physical culture properly pursued, awakens physical consciousness, makes it subtler and less obscure, introducing into it a certain plasticity and control, thereby making it more receptive to higher influences. Dancing is one such ‘exercise’ that reintegrates body, mind, life energy and even the higher consciousness. Yogasanas   also reintegrate body, mind and deeper levels of consciousness. It is no easy task and needs persistence and perseverance. What is of utmost importance however is not the fact of doing this or that exercise but rather adopting a certain attitude within us and a concentrated aspiration in the physical consciousness towards its own higher future.</p>
      <h4>Key to Educating the Body</h4>
      <p><i>The mind with its dogmas, its rigid and arbitrary principles, the vital with its passions, its excesses and dissipations soon destroy the natural balance of the body and create in it fatigue, exhaustion and disease. It must be freed from this tyranny and this can be done only through a constant union with the psychic centre of the being. The body has a wonderful capacity of adaptation and endurance. It is able to do so many more things than one usually imagines. If, instead of the ignorant and despotic masters that now govern it, it is ruled by the central truth of the being, you will be amazed at what it is capable of doing. Calm and quiet, strong and poised, at every minute it will be able to put forth the effort that is demanded of it, for it will have learnt to find rest in action and to recuperate, through contact with the universal forces, the energies it expends consciously and usefully. In this sound and balanced life a new harmony will manifest in the body, reflecting the harmony of the higher regions, which will give it perfect proportions and ideal beauty of form. And this harmony will be progressive, for the truth of the being is never static; it is a perpetual unfolding of a growing perfection that is more and more total and comprehensive. As soon as the body has learnt to follow this movement of progressive harmony, it will be possible for it to escape, through a continuous process of transformation, from the necessity of disintegration and destruction.</i>–  The Mother,  On Education : ‘The Science of Living’</p>
      <h4>Evolutionary Transformation or Disintegrative Destruction</h4>
      <p>This therefore is the real challenge before the human body and every body. The animal body faced this challenge in its earlier leap towards the human form. The human body faces the same challenge today leading to an upsurge in the many forms of illnesses. Seen outwardly these illnesses are threats to survival to be crushed out by powerful medicines that eliminate germs and toxins (and perhaps the body itself in the long run). We forget that animal life knew nothing of all this consciously and yet it overcame the challenges and evolved to a greater possibility of life. The same evolutionary force is once again active in the earth atmosphere calling us to exceed our human limitations. Disease is merely a shadow showing us where we stand in this process. It is an inability of the physical parts to respond with a sufficient plasticity to the evolutionary pressure, firstly due to inertia and secondly due to the long standing habit of response to forces of a lower order. Unfortunately much of our present culture continues to strengthen our animal instincts and thereby making things even more difficult for the body that obeys these extravagances of our vital life of night clubs and late parties with the docility of a tamed animal and an obedient slave. The only way it can make noise or make itself heard is through the agency of illness. But do we listen and make the corresponding change in our lifestyle that precipitated the illness in the first place? The final conquest would not be therefore in eliminating the outer causes of illnesses or our ability to contain them through powerful drugs. The real conquest would be to eliminate the inner causes of illnesses by a spontaneous immunity to every force of disease and disintegration. This demands an evolutionary transformation of the body itself without which we will only replace one illness with another, create one mutant strain of virus after another, substitute one powerful chemical by another, change one form of illness into another without really eliminating them.</p>
      <p>The inner reasons for physical deterioration and aging therefore are:</p>
      <p>(i) An inability of the body to follow, due mainly to its fixity the progressive movement of other parts of the being. The body has learnt to obey the vital impulses (from its animal past) and thought-movements (in our human present).  It does not yet respond to the forces of the higher consciousness (the superconscience). There are yet no centres in the body to respond to the higher touches. The superconscient is not yet organised in the body. In fact that is why traditionally, the body is required to be stilled so as to escape into a trance of superconscience. However the future body will be able to directly manifest the superconscience without resistance, in its waking, active state. Governed by the truth above, it will be able to respond much more surely and effectively.</p>
      <p>(ii) A conditioning of the physical consciousness due to past programming.</p>
      <p>(iii) A secret necessity of life to have infinite experience on a finite basis can also be the cause of aging and death. No form, however great and powerful, can provide this varied opportunity for infinite growth. Therefore, death is used as a device to assume new and different forms under different psychological and physical conditions. This cyclical return of growth through experience is the rationale for rebirth.  In effect, nothing dies – all returns and reconstitutes itself, so that one day each element can manifest the highest harmony.</p>

      <p>Continuing our series on understanding the spirituality of the Human Body</p>
      <p>There is a scientist’s way of looking at the human body and there is a spiritual way to look at it. The two views, though different due to a difference in the angle of the vision, are nevertheless mutually complimentary if we take the larger interests of the human race in its evolutionary progression. The view of the scientist is of course more narrow, his angle of vision more focused on the details of physical processes, his field of enquiry the outward and the immediate. The scientist brings us to the detailed knowledge of the chemical blocks which build our physical body, the laws and processes that govern our physical existence and the means of physical interventions that can help it to remain fit and healthy and function normally.</p>
      <p>The yogi casts a wider look, his angle of vision is broader since his consciousness moves in a larger field of experience – the inner and cosmic. He may not necessarily be aware of the detailed chemical constitution or physical processes governing the body yet his intervention can be more direct, powerful and effective. This is so because he knows the play of the cosmic forces and their subtle laws and occult processes that work upon matter and govern it from behind. Yet his aim of intervention is not merely to secure fitness and normalcy for their own sake but for the fulfilment of a higher Purpose, of the cosmic Will in man. Therefore does a yogi seldom intervene under any pressure of personal will of the claimant to health but rather more and more in alignment to a deeper and larger cosmic Will which sees beyond the outward and the immediate. Unless of course the mere intensity of the personal will is enough to move the cosmic Will.</p>
      <p>There is of course an intermediate terrain between the physical and the spiritual, a domain of mixed possibilities. The physical scientist has begun to recognize this as higher than the physical domain and calls it ‘psychological’. What he means by the term is that our thoughts, will, emotions have their physical counterparts, and through these psychophysical components of our physiology, they can and indeed do influence the physical processes, the organs and their functioning. This is a great discovery and opens doors into deeper territories. As of now however the physical scientist is satisfied with studying only the physical components of our psychophysical parts.</p>
      <p>But just as there is a physical side of the psychological parts, there is a pure psychological side of our physical existence. It is occult to our physical vision and yet is teeming with rich and varied possibilities. It consists of a direct seizing upon of mind energies and life energies and other forms of an intermediate energy and their deft handling to heal and succour. This field known to the occultists, the alchemists and the tantrics of old had taken a backseat in the last few centuries that saw man preoccupied almost exclusively with the physical world and his material existence. The triumphant march of sciences based upon a study of gross matter and its possibilities almost blotted out this other type and even diminished faith in such deeper hidden possibilities. But now since we have explored and sounded the depths of the physical world we see a resurgence of interest in the hidden forces of life.</p>
      <p>As we have said, the view of the yogi is deeper and wider than even the psychological and the occult. This is so because to his unsealed vision there are disclosed not only the stray strands of mental and vital and other energies but also the forces and forms and beings and godheads at each of these universal planes of existence. Instead of simply channelling the ‘energies’ through his personal will, which besides may yet be an ignorant limited and egoistic will, he opens himself to the action and play of the Cosmic Divine and even the Will of the Transcendent Supreme by a progressive surrender of his psychological apparatus and the instrumentality of nature; by a progressive dissolution of the ego to that which is Beyond-ego. The sign of such a surrender is that he no more opens a healing shop or promises miracles to each and everyone who approaches since he can no longer be impelled any more by his own limited personal will or the limited and ignorant will of his clients. He begins to act or rather be acted upon, more and more directly in alignment to a higher Will, more and more silently, yet more and more powerfully. He can claim nothing, nor promise anything unless he sees and knows it as coming from the Transcendent Source of all things.</p>
      <p>What then is this deeper view of the human body, its necessity and its ultimate purpose? How does our health and illness relate with this Purpose? And how can we facilitate this great Purpose through both health and illness? This of course is another point of divergence. For while the scientist (physical and occult) hardly evinces any interest in the body other than its utility for survival and physical (vital existence for its own sake), the yogi, sees further. The yogi sees in the body the capacity to deliver the soul out of its self-willed confinement in matter. According to the yogi, the seemingly unconscious field of matter is pregnant with a conscious soul that has entered into a state of self-oblivion having identified with the unconscious state of matter. It has done this deliberately so that by a slow process of an evolutionary progression it can extract the divine possibilities hidden in matter. This is possible because, in the deepest vision of the seers, it is Spirit that has become matter. And therefore by a process of reversal (what we term as an evolution) matter can reclaim its spiritual status. This evolutionary unfolding takes place by the pressure of the growing soul. As it wakes up, it also wakes up the deeper possibilities of matter – the possibility of sensation, the possibility of impulse to live; of feelings; of thought and ideation. In other words, matter is the field in which seedlings of the Spirit are sown deep, carefully hidden in the folds of darkness of our material existence. These seedlings are watered and looked after by the Divine Gardener who pours down the Light and Breath and Force of a higher sphere of spiritual existence through the mediating agency of the soul. The soul holds the trust deed of this field whose ownership is with the Divine. But till the soul grows and is able to exercise a sufficient degree of influence and control over matter and physical existence, it has to act through the already developed agency of a caretaker mind and life.</p>
      <p>And herein lies the first knot of the problem of our bodily existence. The body has already developed from within itself the powers of life with its fairly elaborate and perfected processes. The powers of mind and their processes and neurological connections are still developing as some latest research tell us. In other words, unlike the processes of life, the processes of cognition are yet not fully laid down and new patterns are replacing old ones. But the soul-powers and soul faculties are still largely asleep except for occasional glimpses from time to time. The yogi’s efforts are therefore not focused so much on physical survival or health and fitness for vital enjoyment or to enhance comfort and sense-pleasure. In fact, the yogi may prefer the instrument to be broken rather than being used by reckless powers of an excess ambition and blind lust. His efforts are to first of all extract the soul out of its entrapment in matter and secondly, to exercise a spiritual control and mastery over material and bodily existence. Thirdly, and lastly, the aim put forward by Sri Aurobindo, to progressively spiritualise and then divinise matter.</p>
      <p>The problem of the bodily existence that the yogi had set to resolve are therefore different from those of the medical scientist. Though they work upon the same field, they work towards a different aim and with different principles and methods. The medical scientist’s job is to repair the damaged bodily equipment and enhance its lifespan for survival purposes or even to prolong the ability of sensory enjoyment, physical pleasures and comforts. Therefore the medical scientist multiplies outer methods of prolonging life, repairing defects, handling emergencies, change of organs, etc. To preserve and prolong is his aim. But the yogi’s interest lies elsewhere. Not survival for the sake of survival, not prolongation of life for fear of death, not a fresh lease so that he can indulge a little longer into sense pleasures. So, his first and foremost aim is to keep the body supple and fit, in a reasonable healthy and balanced state relatively free of serious disturbances so that he can concentrate upon his soul. Not that he cannot do so in a sick body. He can, if he has a strong will, but in the usual case, a sick body, and a body full of tamas and inertia drags the consciousness outward and downward. True, with practice it is not difficult to learn detaching the mind from our physical condition yet that makes the effort so much more difficult, especially if there is too much of inertia. Besides inertia and tamas naturally attract forces of disharmony and disruption, of greed and lust. A physical consciousness that is too tamasic preoccupies itself with food, sex and sleep, etc., attraction to things that make the body heavy and dull or damage the nerves such as alcohol, tobacco, narcotics, heavy or stale food, etc.. Some simple medicines as and when necessary to avoid too much discomfort are okay in this stage when one is simply learning to disengage the soul from the body and mind. Life, death, disease are in this stage mere passing incidents that temporarily block our view or pause for a short while our search for the soul.</p>
      <p>The second level of difficulty arises when having found his soul, the yogi strives to master each and every movement. The law of moderation is to be replaced here by a growing spiritual perfection. It is no more enough to eat in moderation but to eliminate greed completely. It is no more a regulated sex but an effort to completely master the sex impulse. It is no more having a sound refreshing sleep but to become conscious of that very period of rest. Even with regards to illness, the effort is to get rid of it by an inner control and exercise of a spiritual will and by the pressure of a higher consciousness and its forces. One may still need medicines but rarely and in lower dosages for short duration. As the change proceeds, the so-called normal laws of the body no more hold tight. The body itself is seen as a field and a symbol for the play of various forces and energies of different levels of consciousness reflected and represented in the body. This is a long and protracted battle. The vital and the mind do not easily let go off their old misrule. The subconscious caves where these traffickers and robbers hide raise their head again and again. The effort here is to link the physical consciousness to the soul and through it to the higher realms. This is done through aspiration and opening of the physical consciousness to change, a persistent, painstaking, rejection full of perseverance; a constant referral to Grace, its invocation to eliminate the many defects and impulses and a surrender to the Divine Will. As the psychic consciousness grows, as the inner being begins to change under the psychic pressure, as the higher forces accumulate, the task becomes relatively easier though by no means a simple one.</p>
      <p>A distinction has to be made between the psychic control vis-à-vis a mental and vital control of the body. For people with a strong vital will can impose it upon the body. Usually, this vital will in man being subject to the ego and desire, is used for all the wrong purposes. However, sometimes the vital will and the mind can exercise a strong control over the body. Such a control should not be confused with the control arrived at by a psychic and spiritual consciousness. The vital and mental will impose upon the body certain arbitrary rules based on preferred opinions. These rules may even be drastic ones like raw vegan vegetarianism, or breatharians, or food fads, or an extensive exercise programme without proper and adequate rest and sleep. Such a control may appear drastic and swift to arrive but is usually temporary, achieved by a locking up of mental and vital energy in suppressing something, done at the expense of the body’s health (even though people do not always realise it is as in cases of anorexia nervosa). Besides, such a control usually brings a certain rigidity and harshness in nature. The psychic control takes longer because it keeps the little grain of wheat while removing the chaff, but is more complete, carries a sense of harmony, sweetness, peace and joy. Nevertheless, mental and vital control have their own utilities in our evolutionary journey. The mental and vital control is more external such as not eating certain things even though you like them, while the psychic control is more intrinsic such as eliminating greed. Both may therefore complement each other.</p>
      <p>The psychic control is usually in the form of an invitation, a subtle indication of the gesture to be made, the thing to be done and the right way to do it. It has neither the harsh insistence of the mind nor the vehemence of the vital but acts more as a subtle but sure compulsion which we (the mind-vital-body ego) may or may not follow. But if persisted and followed, it leads a harmony and grace to the body, a ring of authentic sweetness and peace in the voice and speech, an unerring impulsion to our bodily movements and a spontaneous resetting of the body’s rhythms in accordance with deeper truths. The food becomes more nourishing and in the right quantity without our thinking or calculating of calories, the sleep becomes much more refreshing and the dreams change their quality, one develops a “natural’ (as contrasted with enforced and artificial) distaste for certain crude impulses such as sex and anger. Fear tends to diminish and finally vanish. The very limbs feel a subtle sweetness flowing through them as a rejuvenating sap of some immortal life, and even the taste and other senses may undergo a corresponding change. A new and deeper sense of beauty comes that is no more deceived by charming appearances and can easily see through them. A spontaneous knowledge, a more subtle but effective will, a quality of tranquillity in feeling and impulsion, a natural state of peace and joy, an uplifting of everything towards the Divine, a clarity that the intellect cannot offer, a goodwill, wideness and love that the heart has not known before, a native generosity of the soul that is equal-visioned towards all and therefore at peace and ease with itself and the world are some of the profound physical and psychological changes that arises with the progressive awakening of the psychic. This itself is a great gain and makes us so much more free from many maladies. But since it is difficult for man to remain in constant touch with the soul, there are lapses and recoils, the revolts of the vital, the surfing up of the mind’s anxieties and fears, the hearts hopes and expectations, the body’s maladies. The subconscient throws up the old ills and habits again in such vulnerable moments and the maladies return. Nevertheless, once the passage is seated for the psychic streams to pour upon the body it becomes easier and easier to get back to the psychic poise and heal the body from within.</p>
      <p>This becomes possible because unlike the mind and the vital, the psychic consciousness can directly link us to the healing forces of a higher consciousness. It can even call down the touch of Grace upon matter and redeem it from its fallen state. And if for some reason it (the soul) decides to leave the body, then one is put in the best and most favourable inner conditions to do so. Then death itself becomes a leap, an opportunity, and crisis an evolutionary lever. If this is combined with a strong faith and will in the mind and the vital then it can make an almost impregnable fortress against almost all illnesses. Such a fortunate combination is however very rare. Often in fact, the story may well be different. A person with a great psychic possibility may be endowed with a great difficulty of nature that is like a shadow which he must conquer to realize his own true strength. And in Nature’s great economy and wisdom the obstacle is so arranged so that it may hasten the inner possibility which would remain dormant if it did not meet the friction and resistance of an opposing force which acts as a stimulant or a challenge to facilitate the psychic emergence. To conquer this rock-like obstacle to facilitate the flow of the soothing streams of the nectar of delight that secretly even now supports and heals our existence is the work of the yogi. This work needs time, patience, faith and courage. It is the work of bringing into the frame of our mortal existence that which exceeds all frames. It is the work of preparing our earthly field called the body to receive and implant seeds of light from another realm whose harvest is not yet known to man. But once it begins to blossom and bloom it will solve all problems of disease, incapacity and death by striking at the very roots of the malady that lie embedded and entangled in the dark concealment of the rock caves of our subconscient nature. Medicines cannot do it, nor can any alternate system of therapy or exercises of techniques of breathing do it for us. These may be and are helpful in their own place and time but only temporarily and perhaps immediately so. But the yogi looks beyond the temporal and the immediate. He looks at concealed parts, parts of light and parts of night and reuniting them becomes a whole.</p>
      <p>From the Yogic point of view each part of the body is symbolic of a higher movement that is reflected here in a more or less distorted manner. Yet there is a subtle correspondence between the two. Now the effort of evolution translates itself in physical terms to create a perfect body that is truly representative of the higher states of consciousness, a body moved entirely by the higher forces and energies rather than by their lower and lesser counterparts as of now. This would naturally lead not only to a perfect immunity that could practically extend to everything but also to a free and full play of Divine Consciousness and its forces and energies in matter. It would bring, in other terms, a complete freedom from all animality and also death-bound, disease prone, desire driven humanity. How will this come about? The first step is to accumulate the forces and energies of a higher consciousness by a constant aspiration, psychic purification and a spiritual opening of the embodied human consciousness right up to the physical. There must increase simultaneously the receptivity of the body-cells to this higher consciousness. A conscious and methodical physical education is one of the means to achieve that. The pressure of the transformed inner consciousness will begin to mould and remould the physical stuff till it finally admits the transformation of each part into a corresponding physical centre of energy.</p>
      <p>Secondly, to a deeper spiritual sight, each part contains the whole in itself. There is a whole universe contained or rather crammed within us. In a transformed body it may be possible to effectuate changes in one part of the world by concentrating on a corresponding part of the body and releasing the higher forces locked there. Each body can become then a representative body of the earth. This is the deeper work of the yogi – to awaken and release the spiritual forces locked in the prison house of matter. And by that release turn this prison into a camp or temple-house of God. The scientist’s work is simply to study and repair the prison-bars, make them strong and lasting. The yogi’s work is to change them and in its place erect something new, something far more beautiful and true.</p>
